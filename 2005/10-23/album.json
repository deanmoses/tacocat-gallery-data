    "description": "Milo's getting more opinionated, and starting to throw tantrums when he doesn't get his way.  He's still somewhat easily redirected, but it's definitely a change from the days when he just crawled and cooed.  He's even starting to chase after Felix and try to take back toys that he thinks Felix took from him.\n\n<p>\nPerhaps to compensate, his sense of humor is develolping.  He never met a fart he didn't laugh at.\n</p>\n\nFelix is getting, well, older.   He wants more Superman books so he can learn everything about him.  And he wonders why sometimes power lines just end, when their job  is to take electricity from the power station to houses.  And he's trying to pin down at exactly what age he's allowed to have small Star Wars legos, and what age he can get a dog.\n\n<p>\nLatest language development:\n<ul class=\"bottom\">\n<li> <u>go!!!</u>: <i>Let's go outside!!!</i>  Not new, but now said the same way a cavalry officer says \"charge!\".  And he does it while banging on the front door.\n</ul>",

    "description": "We're having great fun talking with Felix.  His questions are good and his answers often insightful.  He'll ask Dean how work was and what he learned there.  He has a cute French-ism right now:  instead of saying \"I don't remember\", he says \"I be lost\".  As in, \"Who did you play with in school today?\"  \"I be lost.\"\n\n<p>\nMilo is starting to understand some rudimentary communication, and and is starting to be happy when we understand his wishes.  Today he was crying and Lucie asked, \"Are you hungry?\", tapping at her breast.  Milo stopped crying immediately and beamed at her.\n<p>\n\n<p>\nWe have to print a retraction:  last week we declared the end of diapers for Felix, but in fact he still wears one at night.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo sustained his first gumbo-related injury:  he slipped in the tub while Dean and Lucie were passing a bowl of gumbo, getting a bruise on his eyebrow.  It was small, and disappeared in a few days.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou can also see some pictures of the <a href=\"remodeling/index.html\">remodeling we're doing</a>.\n</p>",

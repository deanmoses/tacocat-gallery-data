The teachers are all very cool and there are lots of things to do.  Felix's class even has a pet rat that crawls all over them!  Felix hasn't made friends yet, but he understands it can take time.  He's showing a lot of good will.\n<p>\nLucie, Felix and Milo have been a little sick. Milo is teething. Despite it all, we had a first rate 4th of July in a small and wholesome little town called Danville.\n</p>\nNew words and baby signs this week:\n<ul>\n<li> <u>boo!</u>: as in \"peekaboo\". Milo LOVES playing peekaboo. He hides behind a door then opens it and goes \"boo!!!\"\n<li> <u>papa</u>: No doubt about it now, he really means Dean when he says it.\n<li> <u>[flapping one arm]</u>: <i>bird</i>. \n<li> <u>[toungue in and out of mouth]</u>: <i>frog</i>. In the process of learning this sign, Milo discovered his toungue. He was fascinated.\n</ul>",

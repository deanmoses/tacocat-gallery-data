    "description": "Milo added TWO new baby signs this week!  We've been modeling baby signs for a few months, but we didn't expect Milo to use them himself so soon. Felix was 14 months-old before he did.\n<ul>\n<li> <u>[opening and closing mouth]</u>: <i>fish</i>. Milo does this sign every time he passes our fish tank. He also sometimes does it for toy fishes, and today at a fish mural on a wall.\n<li> <u>[rubbing hands]</u>: <i>running water / bath</i>.  One evening, same as every evening, Lucie turned on the bathtub faucets and undressed Milo.  But then she took an unexpected detour downstairs to check on something.  As they were going down the stairs, Milo rubbed his hands together -- clearly saying \"Hey mom! What about my bath?\".\n</ul>\n\nFelix is very sweet. Lately he keeps quantifying how much, tall and fast he loves us. A typical exchange:\n<div style=\"margin-left:20px;margin-top:5px\">\n<u>Felix</u>: Papa, I love you a lot\n<br><u>Dean</u>: Aww, I love you too, Felix!\n<br><u>Felix</u>: I love you in a tree!\n<br><u>Dean</u>: I love you higher than an airplane!\n<br><u>Felix</u>: I love you in a cloud!\n<br><u>Dean</u>: I love you as deep as the ocean!\n<br><u>Felix</u>: I love you faster than a speedboat!\n</div>\n\n<p>\nHis most ardent declaration of love so far?  \"Milo, I love you more than my Legos!\"\n</p>\n\nWe're reading longer books to Felix.  One of his favorites is <i>The Giraffe, The Pelly and Me</i>, which weighs in at 80 pages.  It still has pictures, but not many.   Towards page 60, Dean starts summarizing a bit.",

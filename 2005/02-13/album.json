Dean first noticed something that sounded like pre-babble on Wednesday (a lot of \"wuh-wuh-wuh\").  By Thursday it was definitely babble (ba-ba-buh-ba).  By Saturday it was quite nuanced:  happly little babbles when he woke up, serious babbles when he wanted to crawl to something, and plaintive babbles when hungry or tired or just pissed off, like when strapped in the car seat.\n</p>",

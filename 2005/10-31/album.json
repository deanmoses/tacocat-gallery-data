    "description": "Busy week.  Felix's school had a fundraiser, we had a Halloween party, there was Halloween itself, lots of play dates, and Dean was gone most of the week on a business trip.  To Disney World, no less.  Which is not such a magical place to go <i>sans</i> kids.\n\n<p>\nMilo had his 15 month checkup.  The stats:  32 inches (81 cm), 22 lbs 9 ounces (10.2 kg).\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBaby dog got lost <i>again</i>. This time he's well and truly gone with the wind.  We suspect Milo, but we can't pin anything on him for certain.  Thankfully, a neighbor donated a replacement. Even though the new Baby Dog is much cleaner and fluffier, Felix didn't notice a thing. Crisis avoided.\n</p>\n\nMilo hasn't added any baby signs for several weeks. He's moved on to the spoken word.  He even said an approximation of \"Trick or treat!\" when we were out trick or treating.\n\n<ul class=\"bottom\">\n<li> <u>yaaa</u>: <i>yes</i>\n<li> <u>totu</u>: <i>turtle</i>\n<li> <u>nana</u>: <i>banana</i>\n<li> <u>cana</u>: <i>duck.</i> in French: canard\n<li> <u>baaaa-bo</u>: <i>boat.</i> From the French \"bateau\", said like in the song \"bateau sur l'eau\"\n<li> <u>baby</u>: He loves spotting babies.  In books, in strollers, and even himself (pointing to his belly).\n<li> <u>Po</u>: <i>TV.</i> Po is one of the Teletubbies. This is very funny to us, because Felix used to call TV Lala. Lala is another Teletubby.\n</ul>",

    "description": "I'm sure everybody's been hanging breathlessly on the twists and turns of Felix's potty training.  You've reached (we hope) the final episode!  He's no longer in diapers, even at night.  He still has some nighttime accidents, but he's quite firm that he'll never wear another diaper.  He's walking taller, with a spring in his step.\n\n<p>\nMilo has his first tooth.  Lower middle.  No more drool than usual, but he was cranky for a few days before it broke the surface.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo's nanny fired him.  We might have the option of trying again with her in a month or two, but the current situation is that  Milo won't stop crying when he's away from Lucie.  We're not sure what we're going to do.  Lucie had some nice freelance jobs lined up, but that's not going to happen now.  The little bugger is so cute and smiley at home, and so outgoing with strangers, that we never imagined that sending him to a nanny would be a problem.\n</p>",

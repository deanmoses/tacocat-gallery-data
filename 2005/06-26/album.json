    "description": "Milo took his first steps on Saturday!  Dean, Lucie, Felix and Austin all witnessed them.   He's been practicing ever since, a few steps at a time.  If he keeps it up, he'll have completely stopped crawling by next weekend.\n<p>\nMilo can't talk yet, but he sounds like he does. He'll babble a \"word\" back at you with just the right intonation and you really feel like he said something. For example, he'll say \"teeteetoo!\" in a way that sounds just like \"peekaboo!\".\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother first: Milo confirmed he understands some spoken words.  He was taking a bath with Lucie and signed for a toy fish.   Lucie responded, \"Est-ce que tu veux un chien?\" (\"How about a dog?\") without using signs and without there being a dog nearby.    And Milo signed \"dog\".\n</p>\nMilo gets along great with his nanny.  She also teaches at Music Together (a music institute in Berkeley), and is always doing music games with him.  She's impressed with how musical he is.   And Lucie already has a nice contract gig and has started work.  Yay!",

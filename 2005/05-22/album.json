    "description": "We're having gorgeous summertime weather, and are spending as much time outside as possible.\n\n<p>\nFelix got accepted to a great preschool near our house.  He starts July 1st, in just five weeks!   We gave notice to his old school.  Appropriately, the new school is called the New School.   They have rabbits and a garden and the teachers play guitar and they go on lots of field trips.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix is ready for the switch.  He knows he's going to have to make new friends, and seems to be determined to make them anywhere he can.  He's been extra friendly when we're out and about, making friends at coffee shops and playgrounds.   \n</p>\n\nWe visited the New School with Felix just to get him acquainted.   He hung close to Lucie.  At the end he said he liked it, but \"it was a little scary because it was different.\"  Now, when we walk by, he tells people on the street, \"That's my new school!\"",

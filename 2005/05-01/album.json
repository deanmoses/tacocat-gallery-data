    "description": "We spent the weekend around the house.  We're getting a lot of mileage out of our new yard.  Dean likes how the landscapers got geeky with the irrigation:  there's five seprate computer-controlled water zones!\n\n<p>\nFelix used to get scared at the littlest things in a movie, but all of a sudden he's able to watch scary stuff like dinosaurs fighting.  He's even okay when one dies.   His play now includes characters dying.  He's thinking about why people die:  he's got the old age thing, and now he's trying to understand what else can be a cause of death.  When we tell him to be careful when climbing, he'll ask whether he could die.   We're straight with him:  we tell him it's possible he could die, but very unlikely. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo turned 9 months old. Height: 29 inches (73 cm). Weight: 18 lbs 8 oz (8.4 kg). Felix was heavier by over 5 pounds, at that age!\n</p>\n\nMilo's clapping a lot.  Sometimes it's when he enjoys something, like when Felix does something funny, or when he eats something he really likes.   We like the idea of our little gourmand applauding his mushed banana.  Also, we think he said bye bye to someone, but he might have just been repeating Lucie.",

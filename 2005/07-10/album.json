    "description": "Milo can walk!  He can take more than five steps at a time, and seems very confident of himself.  He usually ends his walks in a fairly controlled lowering to all fours, rather than crashing. \n\n<p>\nFelix has had some good days at his new school, but he misses Jasper a lot.  We hear that Jasper misses Felix even more, and doesn't like school at all anymore.   We got them together twice over the weekend.  One time he insisted on picking a bouquet of flowers for Jasper, then said it was \"for both of us, because we love each other so much.\"\n</p>\n\nNew baby signs this week:\n<ul>\n<li> <u>[smacking lips]</u>: <i>food</i>.\n<li> <u>[steering wheel motion]</u>: <i>vehicle</i>.\n</ul>\nHe's very clearly trying to talk.  Sometimes we'll say something and he'll imitate the exact intonation, if not the right sounds.  And we <i>think</i> he's said Milo, mine, thank you, and bye-bye.",

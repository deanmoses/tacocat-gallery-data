    "description": "Nana came for a visit.   Milo started saying \"Nana\" right away.  He doesn't say \"Felix\" yet, so we suggested to Felix that we give him a simple nickname for Milo to use.  He was indignant:  \"No!  Milo needs to learn to say 'Felix'\"!\n\n<p>\nLucie's started working three days a week (instead of two).   Finding a nanny for the extra day was an ordeal, but we finally found someone we like.  Her name is Lucy!  Lucy also takes care of another kid, Jorah, who is 21 months old.  We were very nervous the first day because the last shared nanny fired Milo after a few days of being  inconsolably mom-sick.  But it went great:  Milo and Jorah had a good time together and so did the nanny.  We're keeping our fingers crossed that it continues to work out!\n</p>\n\nMilo still hasn't learned how to not kill himself.  Just today he got scrapes from a stunt on a playground slide, a tumble off a high piece of furniture, and a fall down a short flight of stairs.  In this evening's bath he looked like he'd gone several rounds in a boxing ring.   We're not sure whether it's an extra dose of adventurousness or clumsiness lately.",

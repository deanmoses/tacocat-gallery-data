    "description": "Felix is acting four years old.   He thinks things through.  He asks really good questions -- instead of just asking how something works, he'll try to think of an explanation, and ask you if he's right.   We'll have finely reasoned arguments over what's faster, a race car or Superman.  He has firmly held opinions, like he doesn't care for the color black.   In general, he's in a good space:  more self-assured, confident, and outgoing.  We're really happy with him, and for him.\n\n<p>\nMilo's teething continued this week.  As if that wasn't enough, he got chicken pox (!).  Or at least we think it was chicken pox.  His nanny's other kids have the Pox, though he's never in direct contact with them.   Also, it should have lasted a week and it didn't.  It was here a couple of days, lightly, then faded away.  Through it all, he's been a trouper: he'll be tired and in pain but always manages to return your smile.\n</p>\n\nLanguage:  When you tell Milo any of the following things, he'll rush do do it/go there: sit down, outside, upstairs, stroller, table.  In either French or English.     He's saying all sorts of words, but his pronunciation's so poor that half the time we don't realize it.   Thank god for baby signs -- often we wonder \"did he just say duck/elephant/hat/outside?\", then we'll see him doing the baby sign for it.",

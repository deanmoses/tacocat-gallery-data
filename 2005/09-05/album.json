Tomorrow will be the first day of his school's fall semester.\n\n<p>\nMilo has made the transition to a single nap a day.  That's one more thing making him feel like a full fledged toddler.  His babyhood feels far behind him now.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo is baby signing more and more, plus a few spoken words and heartfelt grunts.  Today, he and Dean had an actual conversation:\n<br /> - Milo signed bird, probably in response to something he thought we were saying.\n<br /> - Dean asked \"Where is the bird?\"\n<br /> - Milo signed I don't know.\n</p>\n\nThe latest additions to his vocabulary:\n<ul>\n<li> <u>uh oh</u>: <i>I dropped something</i>\n<li> <u>[touching ear]</u>: <i>I hear</i>, usually followed by another sign... his first sentences! For example: [touching ear] + [flapping arm] = <i>I hear a bird</i>\n<li> <u>[brushing finger against teeth]</u>: <i>toothbrush</i>.\n<li> <u>[back of hand against nose]</u>: <i>elephant</i>.\n<li> <u>[twirling hands together]</u>: <i>anything that turns.  </i> Example: a fan\n<li> <u>'atty cay'</u>: <i>patty cake</i>, accompanied by clapping hands\n<li> <u>[open-palm shrug]</u>:  <i>I don't know where it is.</i>\n</ul>",

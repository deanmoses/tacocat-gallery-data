He's got several bumps and bruises on his noggin.\n\n<p>\nHe's been -- uncharacteristically -- cranky for the last few days.  We think it's on account of some new teeth coming in.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix had a tough time at school last week.  He decided he didn't like the New School, and didn't have any friends, and was crying when we dropped him off.  We were all pretty depressed about it.  But what a difference  a week makes!  He really likes his teacher Karen who just came back from vacation, and he made a new friend: Owen. We have had a couple of play dates with him, and now Felix says he wants to live with Owen.\n</p>\nTo prepare Felix for our imminent trip to France, Lucie pretends to be Iris, Felix's 3-year-old cousin who doesn't speak any English:\n<div style=\"margin-left:20px;margin-top:5px\">\n<u>L</u>: Bonjour, comment tu t'appelles?\n<br><u>F</u>: Felix.

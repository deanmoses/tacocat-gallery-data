    "description": "Milo's been eviscerating popup books and destroying toys at an alarming rate.  He even managed to break a toy hammer, just by using it as intended.  It isn't mean-spirited or angry, just... vigorously inquisitive.  This behavior has taken us by surprise:  Felix has always been gentle and respectful.   The good news is that Milo does, sometimes, show self-restraint.  We put up the Christmas tree this week and after a few very firm no's, he is staying away.\n<p>\nFelix had his 4 year old check-up.  All systems go.  41 in/104 cm, 39.5 lbs/18 kg.\n</p>\nFelix is showing an interest in reading. We have been enthusiastically playing letter games with him; he's gratifyingly engaged, with encouraging results. He is not yet interested in the writing part of it.",

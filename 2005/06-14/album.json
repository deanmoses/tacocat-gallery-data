    "description": "Milo added a baby sign this week: dog.  We sign it by panting, doggie style.\n\n<p>\nBabushka is in town. Felix is delighted to see his French grandma again.  Milo was cautious at first, but then he warmed up to her.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe can already tell that Milo is right-handed. He favors his right hand for eating, waving, and handling toys.  Felix was ambidextrous well into his third year, before finally veering to the right.   So the entire family is right-handed.\n<p>\n\nMilo, at long last, has a nanny!  Her name is Maria, she also teaches at the Music Together program, and she's awesome.   Milo and her get along great.  They do lots of singing and music games.  She's doing it once a week now, and will start twice a week in July.  Lucie already has work lined up, and is very happy with how things have turned out.",

    "description": "Felix thoughts have turned towards the existential lately.  He's grappling with the idea that he wasn't always here. He asks us about our childhood. He asks \"When I no exist, you missed me? You thought about me?\".  He is also curious about death.  He knows one of his fish died and isn't likely to come back.  We explained that once you are dead, you can't talk or walk or do anything. His response: \"If you no can walk, how about a special chair with wheels?\".\n\n<p>\nAnd he asks \"Why dinosaurs no exist no more?\".   Because the weather got cold and dinosaurs don't have coats or houses.  Follow up:  \"Do elephants still exist?\"  We show him pictures of himself looking at elephants.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelixism: \"I use my magic nation\" (imagination).\n</p>\n\nMilo has been saying \"ma ma ma\" for a while, but now it really sounds like \"Maman\", and it really feels like he means Lucie. He also says \"pa pa pa\", but it's still a little unclear whether he means Dean.",

It's mostly okay when he's Tylenoled to the eyeballs, but he lets everyone know about it the second it wears off.  One of the teeth broke through the gum today, so hopefully it will be over soon.\n</p>\n\nSchool's good.  Felix is enjoying his friends, especially Owen and Torin.   Lucie came to pick up Felix a bit early from school one day and got a \"Why are you here?  I'm still playing!\"   Also, we went to a PTA meeting.  The teachers are all great.  The parents are interesting and involved.",

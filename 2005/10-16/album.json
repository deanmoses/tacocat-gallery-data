    "description": "False alarm: Milo did not have chicken pox after all. It was a viral rash from another, more benign virus. All the spots disappeared after a couple of days, and they were never itchy.\n\n<p>\n\nMilo has a good memory. This week, he went to the Little Farm in Tilden Park with Lucie. He had gone there a month ago. After happily feeding celery to all the animals, Milo went \"Duh??\" and touched his nose... that's baby sign for \"where's the pig?\" And he was right: there had been a pig last month, but it was missing this time. \n\n<p>\nIt's very sweet: Milo loves to give kisses. He kisses his stuffed animals often, and real animals as well, when he gets a chance. He kisses pictures of babies and animals in books. Whenever he plays a little rough and you tell him to be gentle; he stops, and switches to hugs and kisses. \n\n<p>\nLatest language development:\n<ul class=\"bottom\">\n<li> <u>no</u>: <i>no.</i>  That's not a new word, but now he says it <i>all the time</i>.\n<li> <u>no</u>: <i>yes.</i> I warned you: he says it all the time. The intonation is slightly different when he actually means yes\n<li> <u>mommy</u>: His \"mama\" has evolved to a \"mommy\". He learned it from Felix ; Dean says \"mom\" and Lucie says \"maman\". You can tell who he <i>really</i> pays attention to in our house.\n<li> <u>Po</u>: His favorite teletubby.\n<li> <u>dodo</u>: <i>sleepy.</i>\n<li> <u>[touch nose]</u>: <i>pig.</i>\n</ul>",

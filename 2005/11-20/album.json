    "description": "Felix's social skills with kids his age have suddenly gone up a notch.  He'll meet an acquaintance at the playground, hang out and chit-chat, identify common interests, and talk in detail about upcoming events (like birthday parties).  Previously he would have this type of interaction with a few close friends like Jasper, but now he does it with anyone he knows.\n\n<p>\nWe can now fully communicate with Milo about all the common things we do.   We can ask most anything related to food, play or sleep, and he'll give a good yes/no answer.  We can ask him to get his shoes.  We can ask \"Where's X?\" and he'll mostly point to the correct thing... though whenever his concentration lapses, he defaults to pointing to his foot.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix and Milo are getting along better. Milo's starting to respect a few boundaries, like not taking toys directly out of Felix's hands, and Felix is cutting Milo some slack for being a baby.   For example, Milo has a hitting problem -- he'll hit Felix when he thinks he's been wronged.  We intervene immediately and show Milo how to be gentle, but even so, Felix used to get deeply upset.  Now Felix gets a little annoyed, but not upset.\n</p>\n\nMilo's new words:\n<ul class=\"bottom\">\n<li> <u>pop&eacute;</u>: <i>any big truck.</i>  Comes from pompier, French for fire truck.</i>.\n<li> <u>ba</u>: <i>bus.</i> He loves 'em.\n<li> <u>badaboom</u>:  To fall noisily, like a stack of blocks.\n<li> <u>tartine</u>: A tartine is the basic unit of French breakfast:  toast with butter and jam.\n<li> <u>pipi</u>: <i>pee.</i>  He's interested in the potty and toilet.\n<li> <u>caca</u>: <i>poop.</i>  He loves being given a square of toilet paper.  He'll wave it around then throw it in the toilet.\n<li> <u>zizi</u>: <i>penis.</i>  He <i>loves</i> to answer the question \"Where's your zizi?\"\n<li> <u>oooo</u>: <i>the ghost sound.</i>  Haloween made a big impression on him.  On the few times he's been out after dark, he'll go \"oooo\" then \"ding-dong\" and point at the nearest door.\n</ul>",

    "description": "Lucie's been interviewing nannies this week.  Milo totally understands what's going on, and makes it immediately clear whether he likes a candidate or not.  With one he starting screeching in panic the moment she walked in.   His favorite was also the one Lucie liked the most -- we think he may have felt she was a friend, not a nanny.   Nothing's settled yet, but we have some choices we're happy with.\n\n<p>\nFelix watched <i>Mary Poppins</i> recently.  When we talk about nannies, he keeps asking when the woman with the umbrella is coming.\n</p>",

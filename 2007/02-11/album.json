  "description": "<p>Lucie stopped nursing Milo three weeks ago, cold turkey.  For the next two weeks he asked hopefully every night, \"lolo\"?  Lucie would say no and he wouldn't push it.  Finally, some night this week when he asked and was rebuffed as usual, he sighed and said regretfully but philosophically, \"I drank it all up.\"  That was the end of it. He hasn't asked since then.</p><p>As you probably know, Felix loves science.  He wants to go to Berkeley's French-American school because \"if there's a science book in French I need to be able to read it.\"  One day this week he was dragging at lunch so Dean decided to make him nap.  Felix claimed he wasn't tired and he'd feel better if we did a science experiement, any science experiment.  He put up such a fight that Dean had to hold him down.  Felix screamed over and over, \"Science will solve everything!\" until he dropped directly and suddenly into sleep.  After a few minutes Dean got up, which prompted Felix to cry out one more time in his sleep: \"Science will solve everything!\"  The kid clearly does love science.</p>",

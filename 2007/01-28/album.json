  "description": "This was a big week for Milo.<ul><li>He turned 2 &#189;.</li><li>He figured out how to climb out of his crib (without hurting himself).</li><li>He stopped nursing.</li><li>He started responding to time outs (and, for example, helps puts all the books back on the shelf).</li><li>We realized he knows a good portion of the alphabet by sight (i.e., if you say a letter, he can point it out).</li></ul><p>Monday morning. 7 AM.  Instead of calling to be taken out of his crib, Milo simply walked into our bedroom. He snuggled into bed next to Lucie and started nursing (a treat usually reserved for bedtime). In order for this not to become a new time-consuming morning habit, we decided right then and there to wean our little escape artist. Both Milo and Lucie are sad to say good-bye to breastfeeding, but it's going well. The first 2 or 3 nights Milo had a hard time falling asleep, but he has already adjusted. The temptation to climb out of his crib is harder to deal with. </p><p>Milo's language gets better every day. To quote Felix: \"Milo really talks more gooder now!\". While Milo understands that French and English are two different languages, he still mixes them up in his own special blend of frenglish (especially when talking French - his English is more accurate). A few examples:<ul><li>I &ccedil;a va. <em>(I am good)</em></li><li>I want rentrer maison. <em>(I want to go home)</em></li><li>Let's prend l'avion! <em>(Let's take a plane!)</em></li><li>Come arroser fleurs with me! <em>(Come water the flowers with me)</em></li><li>S'il-te-plait, maman, read this un livre. <em>(Please, mom, read this book)</em></li><li>I peur fall dans l'eau. <em>(I am afraid to fall in the water)</em></li></ul></p><p>When Felix was younger, Lucie used to always read books in French to him, even if the book was written in English. She would translate on the spot, or just talk about the images if the story was too hard for instantaneous translation. This does not fly with Milo: he insists that we read the actual words on the page.  And he knows which books are in which language. If Lucie tries to translate he complains, \"No, Mommy! Read en anglais!\" Lucie's been ordering more French books from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.fr\">amazon.fr</a>. </p><p>Milo knows his name is pronounced differently in French and English.<ul><li>If you ask him \"What's your name?\" Milo responds <strong>\"Mylo\"</strong>.</li><li>If you ask him \"Comment tu t'appelles?\" Milo responds <strong>\"Meelo\"</strong>.</li></ul></p>",

      "description": "Felix wasn't into games until we found one that didn't involve winning and losing.  He loves the board game <cite>\"Snail's Pace Race\"</cite> because it's the <strong>snails</strong> that win and lose.<p>Interestingly, he soon put a twist on it:  the snails are on teams, and the teams belong to him and Lucie.  He's okay with his \"team\" losing -- it's apparently enough psychological distance from himself losing.</p>",

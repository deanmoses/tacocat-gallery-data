Hi!  <p>Taking stock:</p><ul><li><strong>Felix</strong> started speaking French, rides a bike without training wheels, and has made a solid start at reading.</li><li><strong>Milo</strong> ditched the diapers <em>(yaaaaaay!)</em>, found a gift for learning songs, and graduated from a trike to a bike with training wheels.  Oh yeah:  he started talking in complete sentences.  Jeez, was that really this year!?</li><li>The company that <strong>Dean</strong> co-founded last year, <a href=\"http://www.widgetbox.com/\">Widgetbox</a>, grew from to 10 to 21 people and so far the gray hairs seem natural rather than stress-related.</li><li><strong>Lucie</strong> achieved an enviable work/life balance, being there for the kids and managing to take the entire month of August off, yet still able to pick and choose her gigs for fun and profit.</li><li>Both <strong>Dean and Lucie</strong> managed to maintain their girlish figures.</li></ul><p>To celebrate an excellent year, we went to our friend Andrew's house for New Year's eve, where Lucie participated in an Iron Chef Competition.   <a href=\"ironchef\">Here's the pix</a>.</p>",

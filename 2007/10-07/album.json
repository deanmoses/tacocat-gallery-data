When we told him it was loose, the expression on his face was priceless:  awe and exhilaration of reaching such a huge milestone. (We've read a LOT of books about loose teeth.)<p>Milo had his first science class.  He's the youngest in the class.  Though he's way into it, three might be a bit too young for this class:  he came home and excitedly told Dean, <em>\"Papa! You brain turn food into poop!\"</em></p><p>Lately Milo has been fervently expressing his love to his family.<div style=\"margin-left:15px\"><u>Milo</u>: Felix, you're my best friend.<br/><u>Felix</u>:  Well, you're my best - um - <em>(trying to think of something truthful that wouldn't hurt Milo's feelings)</em>. Milo, you're my best family partner.  Am I your best family partner?<br/><u>Milo</u>:  Yeah!</div></p>",

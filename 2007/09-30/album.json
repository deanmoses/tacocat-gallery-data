  "description": "Kindergarten continues to rock.  One of the high points is an after-school class called Mad Science.  They're learning about the physics of toys and making Lego Mindstorms robots.  Milo starts in the preschool version next week.  Dean's lobbying the school to start an adult version he can attend.  <p>Milo's gradually warming up to the new school.   Though some days he still cries at drop-off, it seems like a show.  He's certainly learned a lot of new songs and made a lot of art.  He's talking a <em>little</em> more French but not like Felix.  Felix will now be talking to Dean and suddenly drop a sentence or two of perfectly grammatical but halting French, and he looks  surprised that such sounds are coming out of his mouth.</p><p>Felix has become a master biker by dint of riding to school every day.  He's impressed us by progressing to tricks such as jumping off curbs and putting his feet up on the bar.  Go Felix!</p><p>You may have noticed in recent photographs of Lucie that there's a tooth-sized gap in her smile. She had a bridge, which has fallen out way too many times.  This week she finally had a relatively minor oral surgery to put a socket in her skull:  it will take six months to heal before they screw in a fake tooth.</p>",

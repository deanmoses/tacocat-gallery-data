  "description": "This week's milestone: Milo went on his first sleepover!  He and Felix spent the night at Kora and Torin's house. It went very well. Milo was <em>so</em> proud and excited to be allowed go along with Felix. Felix, for his part, enjoyed playing big brother, from helping Milo pack his overnight bag to solemnly promising mom he would take good care of him. Apparently, Torin and Kora took turn playing with Milo. It also helps that Milo has always had a soft spot for Cindee. We hear Milo snuggled with her in bed for an hour in the morning. <p>As for us, we spent the childless evening at home, watching episode after episode of the TV series Heroes (we got the first season on DVD for the occasion). It felt decadent.</p>",

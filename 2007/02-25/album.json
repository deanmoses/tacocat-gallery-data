  "description": "<p>Lucie's odometer ticked over, to 34.  It doesn't feel older.   Perhaps a bit more mid-thirties than early thirties.  Anyway, life is good and she's having more free time because the kids are sleeping well and entertaining themselves more.  They play together beautifully now.  It's a good time.</p><p>One symptom of having more free time is that we spend more time planning stuff for our regular date night every Wednesday.  Lately we've been seeing lots of friends, going to jazz clubs, and generally going beyond the standard dinner-and-a-movie.  Yay!</p>",

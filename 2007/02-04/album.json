  "description": "Milo's moving up in the world:  he traded his crib for a genuine bed!  We weren't even remotely thinking about new sleeping arrangements but Milo returned from Hawaii with the ability to say \"aloha\" to his crib.  He shinnies right up and over. The bars were just making it harder to put him back in.<p>Milo enthusiastically helped disassemble his crib; yet, at the end, when he stepped back and surveyed the remnants of his bed, he cried and cried.  That was pretty much the extent of his mourning.  The first night we put him to bed there was a bit of whimpering for the old regime, but nothing since.</p><p>It's been a week of drawn-out bedtimes, trying to embed Milo.  He revels in his freedom; drops out of bed commando-style, on all fours; and slowly pushes his door open.  He keeps his head down because apparently \"if I can't see them they can't see me\". When we pick him up he looks astonished that we got past his cunning stratagem.</p><p>As of tonight we think we've finally licked it!  He didn't get out of bed at all.</p>",

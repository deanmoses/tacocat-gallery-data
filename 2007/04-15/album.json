  "description": "<p>Milo has started asking for a bedtime song that Felix made up years ago called \"Baby Dog Go To Sleep\".  The lyrics are just that, repeated over and over in a tuneless chant.  He prefers Felix to sing it, but will accept Lucie doing it.</p><p>Felix, encouraged by his song's rave reviews, has undertaken a new song.  It's not finished yet.  But it starts in the same tuneless chant:  \"Springtime, everything's blooming, pear tree's blooming, Springtime...\"</p><p>Dean and Felix have been reading <cite>Ramona The Pest</cite>.  It's a classic book about a girl starting kindergarden.  Ramona takes her favorite doll to Show & Tell.  Now Felix is excited to bring his real dinosaur fossil to kindergarden's Show & Tell.  He's even making us make sure that Ecole Bilingue <i>has</i> Show & Tell when we go to Orientation next month.</p><p>Milo's been saying he wants to go to <i>Keenan-garden</i> too.</p><p>Felix has been asking a lot about numbers lately, and doing simple addition and subtraction (like answering \"What's one and two and one?\")  Today he asked Dean to count as high as he could.  Dean realized that Felix thought each number was going to be as hard to remember as the first ten have been, so told Felix that the numbers quickly start to repeat. Dean counted to twenty-one and asked Felix, \"then comes twenty...?\" and Felix shouted \"TWO!\".  It was off to the races after that:  he helped Dean count to 105!</p>",

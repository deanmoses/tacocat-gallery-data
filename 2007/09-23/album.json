  "description": "<p>September has been declared Grandparents' Month!  Last weekend it was Nana.  This one saw Papa John and Linda wash up on the poop deck of the Good Ship Moses.  The kids have grooved on all the Xtra Lovin.</p><p>Felix continues to knock the ol' kindergarten ball outta the park.  He's speaking more and more French.  His roster of buddies includes Ethan, the twins Addison and Parker, and -- new this week -- Benjamin.  All very nice kids.  The garden teacher, Jean Michel, continues to be the standout.  Felix seems to remember every earthy word he utters.</p><p>Milo's slowly doing better.  He still cries at dropoff but it's lessening;  he's warming up to his teachers; has a friend, Morgane; and recounts with relish his trips to the gym and library.  He keeps singing new songs at home and is miffed when we don't know them.  Dean tries looking them up on the internet, but without much success.  The teachers have promised sheets of lyrics of the most common songs they sing.</p><p>We're very sad to report some terrible news about Milo's ex-nanny <a href=\"http://www.tacocat.com/pix/2005/11/27/slides/maria1.html\">Maria</a>.  While visiting her mother in Vancouver, she died suddenly, in her sleep.  This was Sunday the 23rd.  Maria really loved Milo and Milo loved her.  Last time we saw her was at Milo's birthday party, where they spent hours playing together after all the other guests had left.  It's a good last memory to have of her.  Goodbye, Maria.</p>",

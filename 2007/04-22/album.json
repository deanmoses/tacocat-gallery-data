  "description": "<p>Milo, though he naps beautifully at school, has decided he's done with napping at home.  This is causing problems because he still needs naps like brie needs french bread.  When he doesn't get one he's just a mess for the afternoon.</p><p>We've been trying to force a nap on him, holding him down and singing soothingly over his shrieking (something only a highly trained parent mind can accomplish), but it doesn't work.  His skills of subbornness and stay-awake-at-all-costedness are stronger than, well, our physical strength.  Felix was never this stubborn about napping -- we're a bit at a loss at what to do.</p><p>Other than that, Milo is (as always) charming and goofy, Felix is (as always) interesting and mature and the adults are (as always) busy with work.  Things are going well.</p>",

  "description": "The big news this week is that Felix has started reading!  In the last year he's done a little reading with Ariel, the educational therapist, but hasn't really done it out of that setting.  This week he's started picking up little books at home and reading them, slowly and laboriously, to Dean, Lucie and Milo.  It takes him a lot of effort but he's choosing to do it, and he's very, very proud of himself.<p>When <em>we</em> read, we're seeing him pay more attention to the text.  For example, Lucie was reading some numbers in a book and Felix asked, 'Where are they?  I don't see them.\"  They were written out, rather than numerals.  He never used to ask that sort of question.  Yay!</p><p>Video of Felix reading full sentences to Dean for the very first time:</p><object width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/6Dm0c3k5VwQ&rel=0&color1=0xd6d6d6&color2=0xf0f0f0&border=0\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/6Dm0c3k5VwQ&rel=0&color1=0xd6d6d6&color2=0xf0f0f0&border=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"></embed></object>",

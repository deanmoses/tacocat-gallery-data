You know what Kahlil said? He said that George Bush doesn't want to share! Can you believe he said that?! I told him that George Bush is mean because he started the war in Iraq.</p><p><u>Lucie</u>:  Kahlil is right, you know. George Bush doesn't want to share. He wants all the power to himself.</p><p><u>Felix</u>:  Oh, okay. But that's not as mean as starting a war.</p></div><p>Along with political views, Felix is also developing a sense of his future self.  We passed a fire truck blasting out a fire station, sirens blaring and burly men hanging off it.  He looks at the spectacle for a moment then remarks, \"That's <strong>not</strong> what I want to be when I grow up.\"</p>",

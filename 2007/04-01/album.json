She was born in 1915 and lived a long life filled with love and family.</p><p>Dean told Felix about Granny and he was very sad.  He processed it like he processes so many things:  acting it out and taking different roles.  Felix had Lucie be the kid while he pretended to be the grown-up, and explained to her:</p><div style=\"margin: 1em\"><u>Felix</u>: A funeral is a party for you, except you're dead. <br><u>Lucie</u>: What do people do, at that party?<br><u>Felix</u>: People think about you, and talk about what made you special.<br><u>Lucie</u>: Do they bring presents?<br><u>Felix</u>: Well, not presents like for a birthday.  The presents you give at a funeral is your heart and your love.</div>",

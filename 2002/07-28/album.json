This week, however, we switched to a bigger aperture nipple so meals are faster and not so nap-inducing.  We switched because he was getting frustrated with the speed of the daytime meals.\n\n<p>\nWe now put him to bed while he's still awake.  He cries anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes before falling asleep. Hopefully, he will soon learn to drift to sleep by himself more peacefully.\n</p>",

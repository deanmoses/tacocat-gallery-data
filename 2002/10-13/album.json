In the morning, Sylvie picks up Felix and a 1 year old, Silas, and starts hitting the playgrounds of San Francisco.  Sylvie knows all the story hours at all the libraries, all the music groups, and all the indoor baby gyms.  Felix loves it.  Felix took to her immediately because she's French-speaking, from Belgium.\n\n<p>\nIn the \"small world\" department:  Silas' mother is the sister of a kid that Dean played soccer with in Baton Rouge for years and years.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGrandma Harriet was in town this weekend, but we don't have any pictures to prove it, except that we managed to go to a wedding <i>sans</i> bebe.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

Last Thursday it was a bit chilly out so they went to the SPCA to see the puppies, and a pet store to look at fish.   Felix and Silas were mesmerized by the fish.\n\n<p>\nLast Thursday, the two boys were getting jealous of each other:  they'd cry a bit when Sylvie picked the other up.  We'll see how that plays out this week.\n</p>",

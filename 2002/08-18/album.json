He's started to understand the patty-cake game.  He's started to imitate other physical gestures.  His babbling has taken on the cadences and structures of a real language.  It's getting a little easier to imagine him actually speaking. \n\n<p>\nThe last half of the week, the whole family was sick with a stomach virus.  It wasn't pretty:  we didn't have much of an appetite, and anything we tried to eat went straight back up.  We've mostly recovered now, but Saturday was a long, long miserable day.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

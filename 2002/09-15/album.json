    "description": "<P>\n<P>\n<p>\nFelix is developing a great personality.  He's no longer so focused on mom.  He's intensely interested in people.  He's very inquisitive. He's a smile and giggle machine.  He usually doesn't cry when he falls.  Simply put, he is the best baby ever.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFavorite pastimes include climbing (especially scaling Mt. Lucie and Mt. Dean), hanging out at the playground, and family dinnertimes. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix turned 9 months old.  Weight: 23 lbs 11 oz (10.7 kg). Height:  29.5 inches (75 cm).  That's the same height as three weeks ago (when he went to the doctor because he was sick), but a weight gain of almost 2 pounds.  He's been a world-class eater.  Much to Grandma Harriet's chagrin, he hasn't had mashed potatoes and gravy yet, but that day isn't far off.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

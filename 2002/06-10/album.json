After days of investigation, the doctors figured out it was a virus called <a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/refcap/toddler/toddlerills/11433.html\">Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease</a>, that can last up to 10 days.  It's not dangerous, but poor Felix feels awful, and has some sores on the back of his throat that make it painful to suck.\n\n<p>\nIn this picture, we're at the doctor's, and are giving Felix his first popsicle, trying to get some fluids into him.\n</p>",

    "description": "Felix turns 5 tomorrow, Monday the 11th.  We had his party on Saturday.  He had a blast and so did his umpteen billion pint-sized guests.  Actually, no longer so pint-sized:  they all looked like full bore kids, not a trace of toddler left in them!  \n\n<p>\nMidweek the party looked to be in jeopardy.  Milo got a stomach virus and spent all Wednesday night barfing.  Felix and Dean followed like dominoes the next night.  We kept Felix home on Friday to recuperate and luckily Lucie's stomach proved to be made of sterner, more impervious material.  The household made a full recovery for Saturday's party.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"para\">\nUpdate on Dean's gray hair:  it's been confirmed by multiple people, including Nana.  There's more of it than last week.  Dean doesn't mind it... he's planning on being a silverback gorilla next Halloween.\n</p>",

    "description": "Milo figured out how to really jump, with both feet in the air at the same time. He's been practising for a while, but, until now, he would land on his butt instead of his feet. Milo is so excited about his new skill, that he has been hopping around the house all week-end.\n<p>\nFelix's dentist appointment went very well. The dentist was impressed that Felix let her take care of all 6 of his cavities in one sitting. She said that very few 4 year olds will agree to calmly keep their mouth open for so long. This means that we were able to cancel next week's appointment. Yeah!\n<p>\nIt's impossible to keep track of Milo's vocabulary anymore. New words pop up every day. He has the cutest \"sorry\" when he bumps someone. He knows the names of all of Felix's friends. A lot of his new words are French (mousse, couche, cadeau, froid...), which makes Lucie very happy.",

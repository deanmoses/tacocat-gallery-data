We went to the beach on Saturday (against Felix's will, he just wanted to stay in the RV all the time), stayed in a real live RV park, and saw the Monterey aquarium on Sunday. It was a lot of fun!\n\n<p class=\"para\">\nFelix loves science, and everything is science to him. After witnessing a pencil eraser in action for the first time, he couldn't contain his excitement. \"How does it work? Where does the pencil mark go? Can I cut open the eraser to see what happens inside? Why does it only work with pencil?\". Another example: he likes to compare different yogurts on the solid to liquid scale.\n</p>",

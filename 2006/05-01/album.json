Papa Torin!\".\n\n<p>\nHe's quickly advancing on many linguistic fronts:  speaking more French to Lucie, speaking more two-word sentences, and a vocabulary that's months and months past any attempt at cataloguing.\n</p>\n\nLucie got a new contract job.   It's a great gig, but it's full time, so both kids will be at nanny/school all week for five weeks or so.  (Usually Felix gets a Mom day on Wednesday, and Milo gets it Monday and Wednesday.)",

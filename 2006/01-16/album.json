He no longer grabs toys from Felix's hands, nor does he detroy Lego creations (or, at least, not as often). We are having trouble with teaching him not to throw... he doesn't get that it's sometimes okay (a ball), and sometimes a big no-no (he'll cheerfully throw a shoe at your face). Same problem with hitting, which comes from witnessing Felix mock-fighting.\n</div>",

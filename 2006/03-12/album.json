Soon after, he walked into a wall and Lucie asked him if it hurt.  He gave the baby signs for hurt and all gone.   Guess his head's stronger than the wall.\n<p>\nFelix went to the dentist this week for his bi-yearly check-up. X-rays revealed that he has 6 cavities. Yikes! There are all between his molars. We are going back next week to take care of them. \nAccording to the dentist, his problem is that his baby teeth are bigger than average, and they are really jammed together. So now, we floss Felix's teeth. \n<p>\nOwen came over for a few hours on Sunday.\nWe didn't take a picture, but Owen and Felix made the biggest mess ever in Felix's room. It was rock-star-in-a-hotel-room.  They emptied every single toy box and drawer. They even took the mattress off the bed and piled it on top.\nCleanup has yet to be fully completed.",

    "description": "For the last 6 months, Dean has been working on starting a new company with two colleagues from the previous company he helped start.  It's been hectic doing his day job AND the new thing.  Four weeks ago he went on vacation from his day job to concentrate on the new one.  Two weeks ago he quit altogether.   We hit a big milestone Friday:  the venture capitalists and our lawyers finally completed all the negotiations and 1.5 million dollars has been wired to our bank account.   Now we can rent office space and start hiring.  Oh yeah, and we can pay ourselves.   Dean's title is CTO (Chief Technical Officer).  \n\n<p>\nThe company's name?  There's a temporary one, but let's not make it any more permanent by putting it in writing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhat does it do?  The last company made software for big companies to run their web sites.   This time around it <i>is</i> a web site, sort of, and it's for consumers (you).  Stay tuned for more details:  in a few months YOU may be using it!\n</p>\n\nIn other news, check out this <a href=\"milo_flip.mov\">short movie of Milo doing a flip</a>.",

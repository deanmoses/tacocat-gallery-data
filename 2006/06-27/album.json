    "description": "Felix is loving the swim program at his school. He has been coming back home with fabulous tales of heads under water, feet kicking, and real bona fide swimming. We know he must be embellishing somewhat, but his enthusiasm is contagious. On Tuesday, Lucie took advantage of a slow day at work to join Felix and his school mates to the swimming pool, so she could witness his prowesses, and take photos. As we suspected, he is not *really* putting his head under water or swimming on his own yet, but he is doing great. He is splashing and kicking and bopping around with the best of them.\n<p>\nIn addition to the selection in this week's regular update, you can look at yet <a href=\"swim/index.html\">more photos of New Schoolers at King's Swim.</a>",

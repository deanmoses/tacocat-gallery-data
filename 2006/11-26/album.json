    "description": "Happy Thanksgiving!\n\n<p>\nFelix is busy doing \"kindergarden school\" homework most nights.  Lots of mazes, which is improving his pencil grip and drawing skills. He's also working on his notebook of sounds.  Each sound has a hand motion associated with it, like a fanning motion for \"Ffff\".  We find pictures of things that start with each sound and paste it into the notebook.  It's really working:  he's increasingly aware of each sound in everyday conversation, as opposed to just when he's asked to think about it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo has an eye for Starbucks coffee.  We were in the car and Dean mentioned he'd like to stop at the next place.  Twenty seconds later Milo shouted \"Coffeeshop!\"  He had seen a small, tucked-away Starbucks logo whizzing by at sixty miles an hour. He also has a taste for lattes:  Dean lets him have one lick at the foam on top, and Milo makes a big show of going \"Mmmmmm!\" and rubbing his tummy.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"para\">\nIf you have a Windows computer, you can check out <a href=\"video/tickle-monster.wmv\">this video of Keenan chasing Milo</a> on a hike.\n</p>",

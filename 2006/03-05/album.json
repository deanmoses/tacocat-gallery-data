    "description": "One day a week, Milo stays with a spanish-speaking nanny, Lucy. We've recently realized that Milo actually understands some Spanish! For example, if you ask him \"&iquest;donde esta tu mano?\", he correctly shows you his hand. Lucy reports that Milo understands everything she says. Also, we are pretty sure he says \"aqua\" sometimes (though he still favors the baby sign for water).\n<p>\nFelix is learning a little spanish as well. One of his main teacher, Alfonso, is from Peru, and has been giving Spanish lessons to the kids. Felix is fascinated with the concept of foreign countries, with their different languages and customs. He remembers his trip to France very well, and wants to go back. Also, he says he wants to go to Mexico. Felix's favorite afternoon teacher, Gabriel, just came back from a 3 months trip to Mexico; he and Felix have been swapping travelling stories.\n<p>\nFelix says that when he grows up, he wants to be a teacher at his school. He's got it all figured out:   \"I'll still live here with you guys, except I'll be grown up, so I can to walk to school <i>all by myself</i>.\"",

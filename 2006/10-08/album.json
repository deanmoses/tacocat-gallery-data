    "description": "A lot of people say to Dean and Lucie, \"Because of the website we know what's up with the kids to the last detail.  But what's up with you two?\"  Well, here goes:\n\n<p>\nLucie is working on redesigning SFGate, the website of San Francisco's newspaper, The Chronicle.  It's fun and as part of testing the design she gets to meet many avid/rabid users of the website.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nDean's company, <a href=\"http://www.widgetbox.com/\">Widgetbox</a>, has launched. They did a big presentation at a conference in San Diego two weeks ago that was very well received.  Lots of journalists are writing and blogging about them.  They're trying to keep the company small (there's only 5 employees right now), but there's pressure to get bigger faster. It's fun but time consuming.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe both feel the time crunch. Lucie fights to keep her work commitment under 20 hours a week and Dean is always home by 6:45pm, walking out of an office that's working full tilt.  Especially for Lucie, small changes can have a big impact:  working an extra two hours in a week often means she either misses the gym that week, misses sleep, or misses buying groceries.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"para\">\nFelix and Milo are the beneficiaries of Lucie's 20 hour work week: she works at New School one day a week, takes Milo to gym class and has started this week taking Felix to a class at the Lawrence Hall of Science.  It's about making science-related toys.  This week they made sort of a treasure hunt toy, but the coolest thing Felix discovered was the existence of wipe-off pens.\n</p>",

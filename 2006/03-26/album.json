    "description": "Milo's word of the week: \"mine.\"  He says it in the cutest, non-agressive way, usually to mean \"I want to do it myself.\"  He's still a remarkably generous toddler and will give his last cookie to anyone who asks.\n<p>\nA few weeks ago, Felix complained that some days at school he's just not sleepy and doesn't want to nap. Since he only naps about every other day at home, it seemed reasonable.  We told his teacher that naps were optional and made a new rule:  no nap at school = earlier bed time.  Felix agreed to take naps at school most days, but as the days went on he seemed to be more and more tired.  The culmination was this week:  while picking Felix up at school, Lucie realized that he had mastered the skill of lying!\n<p>\n<u>Lucie</u>: Did you nap today?\n<br><u>Felix</u>: Yes I did.\n<br><u>Lucie</u>: But your name isn't on the nap list.\n<br><u>Felix</u>: They forgot to write it down.\n<br><u>Lucie</u>: Are you really really sure you napped?  You said you napped yesterday, but you were awfully tired last night...\n<br><u>Felix</u>: I am sure I napped.\n<br><u>Lucie</u>: Let's ask Suzanna (the nap teacher).\n<br><u>Felix:</u> I don't want to ask Suzanna, I want to go home.\n<br><u>Lucie</u>: Suzanna, did Felix nap today?\n<br><u>Suzanna</u>: Felix?  No, he hasn't napped in 2 weeks, since you said he didn't have to anymore.\n<p>\nWe both had a stern talk with Felix about telling the truth, and the need for a good night sleep. He's once again a napper at school. Still, it's unnerving to know that he can lie with a straight face.",

    "description": "We've been playing a lot of hide and seek lately. Felix is excellent at creating good hiding places. Milo prefers hiding with a parent; though he has learned to stay quiet and (almost) motionless when hidden. When the kids seek, Dean and Lucie have to do lots of coughing to be more findable. Bonus: the boys are getting better at counting to 10. \n<p>\nFelix's new teachers gave out a questionnaire asking if there were special things we'd like the kids to learn this year. We asked Felix. He replied he wanted to learn 2 things: how airplanes work and how submarines work. We asked about reading, and he said that was a good thing to learn in kindergarten.\n</p>\nWe were dumfounded and awestruck Tuesday morning when Felix came down for breakfast <i>fully dressed</i>. Up until that point, he had claimed to be unable to dress himself and showed no interest in picking out his clothes. But ever since that momentous morning he has been selecting his clothes (tastefully, we must add) and dressing without so much as a reminder from us. We can't think of a single thing that might have caused this.",

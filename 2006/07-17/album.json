Felix likes to trick Milo into saying things he doesn't really mean.\n<p class=\"conversation\">\n\t<span class=\"boy\">F</span>: Milo, are you the big brother?\n\t<br /><span class=\"boy\">M</span>: Yeah.\n\t<br /><span class=\"boy\">F</span>: No, Milo! You are the little brother!\n</p>\n<p class=\"conversation\">\n\t<span class=\"boy\">F</span>: Milo, do cats like to play in the water?\n\t<br /><span class=\"boy\">M</span>: Yeah.\n\t<br /><span class=\"boy\">F</span>: Mom! Milo thinks cats like playing in the water!\n</p>\n<p>\n\tMilo is delighted that Felix talks to him, and doesn't seem to get that he's being made a foil for his brother's superior cognitive abilities. As for us, we figure any conversation is a good conversation. It's nice that Felix has figured out a way to have a chat with Milo.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo is taking a break from potty training. He was having more and more spectacular peeing accidents all over the house, so we decided to re-diaper him. He does occasionally ask to have his diaper taken off to use the toilet. He likes wearing underwear though, and he occasionally insists on wearing a pair on top of his diaper. \n</p>\n\nDean's company is going well.  It's about to launch and they've been working day and night.  He's (mostly) been making it home to wrestle and Lego with the kids for a while each day, and we haven't missed a weekly date night (except for when poor Maria, our nanny, was in the hospital...).",

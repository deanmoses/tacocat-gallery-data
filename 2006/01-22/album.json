    "description": "Felix is bringing home from school more than artwork and runny noses.  He's getting opinions from people other than Dean and Lucie!   It was bound to happen, but it was nevertheless suprising the first time he went on about cigarettes.  And then about sugar.   It was inevitable, and we don't disagree with these particular opinions though we could wish them to be more nuanced.  Just... there was this unconscious assumption that we'd have 10, 20, 30 years to indoctrinate him to our particular world view.  Poof.\n\n<p>\nMilo started pooping in the potty.  Not every time, not even most of the time, but definitely at bath time.    He's not concerned by near misses or misses of any kind, really.   And we have something to say to whoever snuck in and taught him that the bathroom scale is an acceptable potty:  NOT FUNNY.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo's words of the last two weeks:\n<ul>\n\t<li><u>Milo</u>:  Show him a picture of himself, and he says his name!  He still can't say Felix, though.</li>\n\t<li><u>pita</u>: <i>pizza</i>.   Cheese, sausage, onions -- it's all good. </li>\n\t<li><u>cheepuff</u>: <i>cheesepuff</i>.  Stroller food.</li>\n\t<li><u>chee</u>: <i>cream cheese or butter</i>.  For putting on <u>bo</u>.</li>\n\t<li><u>bo</u>: <i>bagel</i>.  What you put <u>chee</u> on.</li>\n\t<li><u>ouse</u>: <i>house</i>.  There certainly are a lot of them when you walk down the street.</li>\n\t<li><u>wee</u>: <i>tree</i>.  Often found near <u>ouses</u>.  When Dean says \"big tree!\" Milo responds \"wow.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\nWe went to a cocktail party and took <a href=\"cocktail_party/index.html\">pictures of some old friends</a>.",

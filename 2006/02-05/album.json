It feels good. \n\n<p>\nPapa John and Linda came for the weekend and we had a great time. Felix, having heard so many stories of Dean as a boy with Papa John, was very much looking forward to their visit. They took Felix to the Berkeley art museum (without Dean or Lucie). Linda, an artist and ex art teacher, must have given Felix a first class tour because he came back saying the museum was <i>amazing</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo is in a fantastic mood these days. He is always laughing. That is, except when he throws a tantrum.  Even then he's  so theatrical and brief about it he manages to be cute.",

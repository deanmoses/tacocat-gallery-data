    "description": "Happy New Year!\n\n<p>\nFelix loves a good rule. He's incrasingly looking out for them, even when they aren't to his benefit.  Recent examples:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<i>When given a time out next to a bookshelf:</i> You can't give me a time out here... this place has books!\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<i>When asking for a banana:</i>   You can't give me that.  I didn't say please!\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nMilo still uses words sparingly, but he knows a bunch of them.  Words of the week:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>beep beep</u>: <i>make way!</i>  When Milo needs someone to get out of his way, he'll do the most adorably goofy \"beep beep!\"\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>o-hee</u>: <i>coffee</i>.  He likes to talk about Dean's coffee at cafes and at home.  He'll even pretend to make coffee in his play kitchen.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>a-teau</u>: <i>gateau (cake)</i>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>bubble</u>: Mostly used to talk about his book about bubbles.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>wah wah wah</u>:  <i>cry</i>.  Refers to The Wheels on the Bus song and book.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>rory</u>:  <i>Frosty</i> (the Snowman).  A favorite book.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>mimi</u>:  <i>Mimi</i>.  Mimi the mouse, a favorite book.\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"book/index.html\">story that Felix and Dean wrote</a>.",

It comes out \"fay-eeck\" but what's important is that Felix understands it.  Felix has been noticably more interactive with Milo because of it.  Milo can also say Maria (\"ria\"), which makes Maria very happy.\n</p>\n\nMilo's teething. One incisor broke the gum, and the others are right behind. When the Tylenol wears out, he gets cranky.

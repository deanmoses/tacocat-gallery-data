    "description": "Dean's company (finally) got the keys to their office last Thursday (May 25th).  That weekend Ed and Giles did superhero work running ethernet cable and setting up desks delivered from IKEA.\n\n<p>\nMonday was a holiday.  Tuesday morning everybody began putting together computers and office stuff.  Chairs arrived in the afternoon.   Throughout the day people were actually trying to build software, too.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOffice equipment rolled in all week:  phones, printers, a stereo.   Cleaning service, garbage service, bottled water service were all arranged.  Construction workers popped in and out to fix ceilings, doors, and more.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo cap off the week, Friday night after a few beers Dean and Giles installed some massive 4'x8' whiteboards using special glue and screws.   They almost look like someone sober was wielding the power tools.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhat does the company do?  We'll be letting the world know soon!\n</p>\n\nReturn to <a href=\"../index.html\">rest of the week of June 4th</a>.",

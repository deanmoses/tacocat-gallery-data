One day he came out with a 'one two three' on his own.  A day later he did 'un deux trois' with Lucie -- and she hadn't really been counting much with him.   He seems to get the French and English terms for something at almost the same time, regardless of how much he's heard one or the other.\n</p>\n\nYou can <a href=\"new_office/index.html\">read more about Dean's company</a>.",

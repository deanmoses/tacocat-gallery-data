    "description": "The weather has been amazing. We're wearing shorts and sandals. The trees are blooming. It's hard to believe it's February.\n\n<p>\nFelix and Milo are both sick. Milo has pink eye, which looks nasty: his eyes are bloodshot and oozing mucus. The poor munchkin's a trooper, though; he's kept his good humor except when we try to clean the goo out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix recently declared that pink is his favorite color. Lucie took him clothes-shopping this week and he got really excited at the prospect of a pink outfit.  The sales clerk were taken aback:\n<ul>\n<li><u>Lucie</u>:  Excuse me, I'm looking for a short sleeve pink T-shirt.\n<li><u>Clerk</u>:  How old is the girl?\n<li><u>Lucie</u>:  It's for my son here.  He's 4.\n<li><u>Clerk</u>:  Sorry, we don't have anything.\n<li><u>Lucie</u>:  What about that one? It's pink. Is it short sleeve?\n<li><u>Clerk</u>:  This one is for girls. We sell pink clothes for girls. We don't have pink clothes for boys.\n<li><u>Lucie</u>:  What's the difference?   Kids are shaped the same at that age...\n<li><u>Clerk</u>:  But look!  It has a sequined heart on it!\n<li><u>Felix chimes in</u>:  I love it! That's what I've always wanted!\n<li><u>Lucie</u>:  We'll take it\n<li><u>Clerk</u>:  [look of disgust] - Whatever you say, ma'am.\n</ul>\nHis school has been excellent about it: none of his classmates have given him a hard time about the pink, or even the sequined heart.   Our guess is that his classmate Amit has paved the way:  he exclusively wears dresses and skirts.  He even has the most adorable miniskirt that says \"Party Girl\".",

    "description": "For all of Milo's life, he and Lucie have been dropping off Felix at school.  This week he stopped being a visitor and became a school kid himself! He passed with flying colors.  He loves having his own cubby, just like Felix.  He's picked out his favorite potty (they have a long row of variously-sized and variously-painted toilets).  He knows the name of his teachers, and has even brought home his first drawing.\n\n<p>\nIt's a good time to start:  during this summer period there's 5 adults for the 7 two year olds, so he's getting a lotta lovin'.  There's been some crying but nothing like the panic when the normal kid starts school, including Felix.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix has been an absolutely awesome big brother. He hangs out a lot with Milo in two year old part of the school (the older kids can visit the younger, but not vice-versa).  He's taking it very seriously that Milo adjust well to school.   At home, they get along like never before.  It's great!\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlso helping Milo's adjustment is that Lucie has started assisting at school for a half day every Monday.  This Monday was her first time.  It really helped Lucie get to know the Milo's teachers and classmates.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAt the end of the week, the snacktime teacher said the nicest thing about Felix and Milo:  <cite>&ldquo;I wish I could clone those two!  They're the sweetest kids in school.  They ALWAYS say please and thank you.&rdquo;</cite>\n</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Milo's having a language explosion. The odd complete sentence is starting to pop out of his mouth, though it's still rare enough to surprise us.  He's been counting to 10 in French and English for a while, but is now doing it consistently.   He knows and loves the ABC song, and sings along if you start it.  Favorite letter?  Double U, big fat W!\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"para\">\nFelix's engineering skills continue to improve. He can imagine something, like a new kind of paper airplane, and direct us in the assembly of it.  (Though imagining a <em>flying</em> plane is a ways off.)  And he's starting to incorporate mechanical elements into his lego designs, like hinges.  When we say &ldquo;designs&rdquo;, we mean it:  he'll imagine what he wants to build, then go about it.\n</p>",

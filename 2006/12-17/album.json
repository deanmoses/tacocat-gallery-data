    "description": "Felix has been going to an educational therapist for the last two months to work on his pre-reading skills.  We thought that actual reading was a year or more away.

It's making him cantankerous at times.  In between the bouts of unreasonableness, though, he's being a joy with new verbal dexterity.  He loves singing and his repertoire is expanding by the day.  If he can't actually pronounce a word yet, by golly he'll say the closest thing he can and plow on with the song.  It's adorable!\n</p>",

    "description": "Felix often pretends to be Keenan, who is 12.  As Keenan, he pretends to do big kid stuff:  watch scary movies (even making up a scary plot), read books (with no pictures!).  He has Lucie or Dean pretend to be Felix, unable to do whatever big boy thing he's doing.  Sometimes he has Milo be Nosy, the Joyce's cat, and tells the Felix stand-in to watch out for her claws.\n\n<p>\nMilo's adding more songs to his repertorire: the opening phrases of <i>Trot Old Joe</i> and <i>Knick Knack Paddy Whack</i>.  Some songs he tries to say the words, others he just goes la-la-la or da-da-da.  But he totally has the melodies.\n</p>\n\nMilo is obsessed with TV. He climbs on the couch and forcefully yells his program of choice: \"Mimi\" (Mimi the Mouse), \"Po\" (Teletubbies), or E-I-E-I-O (a DVD where chidren sing <i>Old Mac Donald</i>).  When we refuse, he throws an absolute fit.",

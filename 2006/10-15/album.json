It happened on a specific minute.  Friday. Three in the morning.  He had been crying because of teething so was in our bed, which happens only once every few months.\n<div class=\"conversation\">\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Milo: </span><em>[Sing-songing.  I think it was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.]</em></p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Dean: </span>Milo, go to sleep.</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Milo: </span>Why?</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Dean: </span>Because it's nighttime.</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Milo: </span>Why?</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Dean: </span>Because it's dark.</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Milo: </span>Why?</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Dean: </span>Because the side of the Earth with Berkeley on it has rotated away from the sun.</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Milo: </span>Why?</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Dean: </span><em>[Doesn't answer; Milo can't really be interested?]</em></p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Milo: </span>Why Papa?</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Dean: </span><em>[Prentending to sleep....]</em></p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Milo: </span>WHY ROTATE, PAPA?</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Dean: </span>Because when the solar system formed, everything was spinning as it solidified.  Without the rotation you wouldn't exist, Milo.</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Milo: </span>Why?</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Dean: </span>MILO!  GO TO SLEEP!</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Milo: </span>Why?</p>\n</div> \n\n<p>\nHe hasn't stopped asking \"Why?\" since.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBoth boys passed their dental exams with flying colors.  It was Milo's first and he wouldn't have done it except for Felix's sterling example.  And it was a relief that Felix had no cavities because last time he had several.  The flossing's such a pain, but paying off.  Felix nearly broke down before the appointment when he learned that even WITH the flossing there was a chance the dentist would find cavities:  that wasn't part of the deal!\n</p>\n\nSometimes Lucie forgets how to say something in French.  Same with Alfonso, a Hispanic teacher at New School.  Felix is fascinated by that, and asked Lucie:  \"Does Papa still remember how to speak Baton Rouge?\"  He seemed to be surprised that Dean spoke English his entire life.  Also during this conversation, Lucie realized Felix didn't know that Lucie speaks French to him.  Felix was astounded:\n<div class=\"conversation\">\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Felix: </span>But I don't speak French!</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Lucie: </span><em>[In French]</em> You understand French. I bet you could speak it if you try.</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Felix: </span>How do you say \"Would you like to play with me?\"</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Lucie: </span>Est-ce que tu veux jouer avec moi?</p>\n\t<p><span class=\"person\">Felix: </span>Would you jouer avec me?</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"para\">\nAnyway, Lucie's happy that he's at least starting to consider speaking French.\n</p>",

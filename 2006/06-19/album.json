    "description": "Milo's potty training continues full throttle. He spent most of the weekend at home, pantsless with potties strategically placed around the premises.  We had no accidents! We don't even need to remind him anymore. He knows when he needs to go and gets there pronto. Also, he really wants to clean up after himself: he empties the potty in the toilet, climbs a stool to the sink, and rinses off the potty, sort of. This process is often a bit messy but we really appreciate the sentiment. \n<p class=\"para\">\nToday, Monday, marks the start of the summer session at Felix's school. Felix is enrolled in the swim program. He goes to the pool every day for 2 weeks, then 2 weeks off, then 2 weeks on, etc, for a total of 6 weeks. He was very anxious about his first day -- he had a meltdown when Lucie dropped him off, and we were worried that he wouldn't give it a chance.  But, in fact, he loved it!  All his best friends go. Felix proudly gave us demonstrations of the back stroke, front stroke and side stroke in the bathtub this evening.  We're so proud of him!\n</p>",

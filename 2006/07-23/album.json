    "description": "Dean and Milo had a combined birthday party:  33 on July 22 and 2 on July 24.  It was a lot of fun!\n\n<p>\nMilo's acting older.  One recent first is deferred gratification: Lucie handed him a box of crackers in the grocery store, which he usually devours in the store.  This time he decided they were for the car.  And he actually waited!\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlso, he's graduated from baby books to books with plots.  He has firm opinions on which book he wants, and will search through the shelves until he finds the one he's thinking of.\n</p>\n\nMilo's also going through a phase where he gets scared easily.  The experts say it's common at his age, because a two year old's imagination has grown faster than his logic skills -- he really *does* think the guitar next door will explode if it plays too loud.  And he has a fear/fascination of things that go up but don't come back down, like rockets and balloons.",

    "description": "Today is Dean and Lucie's wedding anniversary.  In a tradition we keep meaning to break, we mostly forgot about it.   However, Friday we <em>did</em> at least get out of the house for the entire night to go something decidedly unromantic:  the worldwide premiere of the movie <cite>Snakes on a Plane</cite>.\n<p>\nSome of our friends -- such as Austin -- had the idea to rent an entire 370 seat movie theater and have a fully stocked open bar during the screening.  It may have been crazy, but it certainly wasn't stupid:  they sold every single seat within hours of announcing it.\n</p>\nReturn to the main <a href=\"../index.html\">August 20 pictures</a>.",

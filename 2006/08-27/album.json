    "description": "Week two of Milo at school.  <strong>The good news:</strong>  Milo likes school.  <strong>The bad news:</strong> he likes the three year old class better than the twos.  He never asks to stay home but does beg to stay with Felix.  So Lucie has, in fact, started dropping Milo off with the 3 year olds.  He eventually filters back to the twos when it's naptime.  We think.\n<p>\nMilo has his first nickname:  Meelo-mylo.  Since Lucie calls him &ldquo;Meelo&rdquo; in French and &ldquo;Mylo&rdquo; in English, people at school put the two together.  Doesn't seem to faze him. \n</p>\n<p>\nFelix continues to come up with great games.  Today he was a trucker/hunter, catching and killing dinosaurs to sell their meat to the grocery store (played by Dean).  Each type of dinosaur had its own baroquely gruesome method of getting killed in a trap.\n</p>\n<p class=\"para\">\nHere's an utterly cute audio recording of <a href=\"audio/milo_abc.wma\">Dean and Milo singing the ABC song</a>.\n</p>",

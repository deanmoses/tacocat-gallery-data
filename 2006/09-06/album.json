    "description": "School was closed this week. Lucie, Felix and Milo had 10 fun days of playdates, excursions and plain hanging out.\n<p>\nFelix is a scientist at heart. He is fascinated by why things are, and how things work. Not only is he constantly asking pertinent questions and gathering all sort of facts, he is also coming up with theories. For example, he explained to us how a diver's tank extracts oxygen from the surrounding water, so that the diver can breathe. That's not how it really works, so clearly he is not just regurgitating information, but it's an intersting idea. \n</p>\n<p>\nMilo sings more and more.  It's the cutest thing ever. In the morning when he wakes up, he often spends a good 5 minutes singing <i>Old Mac Donald</i> in his crib before asking to come out. Other current faves include <i>Itsy Bitsy Spider</i>, <i>Bateau sur l'eau</i>, <i>Yellow Submarine</i> and <i>Dodo dodo, l'Enfant Do</i>\n<p class=\"para\">\nMilo's language is improving on a daily basis. He is sort of talking in sentences now, saying things like &ldquo;read that book please&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&eacute;b&eacute; faim, b&eacute;b&eacute; want biberon lait&rdquo;, or &ldquo;no want apple, want chocolate cookie&rdquo;.  His manners are excellent; always ready with a please and thank you.\n</p>",

    "description": "Lucie takes Felix to the Lawrence Hall of Science for a science class on Mondays.  They stepped into the latest session and it turned out to be a kids only class -- no grownups allowed.  Felix managed to keep it together when Mom left, and had a blast.  The next session, he was VERY proud to march in by himself and wave bye to Lucie.  Lucie brought Milo to see the museum while waiting for Felix, and <i>Milo</i> was very proud be included in the previously Felix-only outing.  He understood it was a big boy thing.  Except he had been mis-hearing what Lucie and Felix had been going to, and kept yelling, \"Iron Giant! Iron Giant!\" instead of Lawerence Hall of Science.\n\n<p>\nDean and Felix are reading <cite>Stuart Little</cite> at bedtime, two chapters a night.  There's hardly any pictures.  Felix loves it.  Dean's already thinking of when they can read <cite>Harry Potter</cite> together.\n</p>\n\nMilo's adding more and more grammar. In the last week, \"I Superman!\" has become \"Papa, I Superman.  You bad guy.\" So far the grammar is mostly English.",

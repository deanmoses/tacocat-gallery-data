    "description": "Felix's 5th birthday is coming up and he's certainly moved into a new phase of his life.  He's gotten a massive confidence boost from going to the educational therapist and succeeding at learning sounds and letters.  One big change is he's become more open to challenges of every sort.  Today we went on a long bike ride (a first in itself), and he managed to hit a parked car and have a bad fall.  After the tears stopped flowing he hopped right back on the bike and kept at it.  The old Felix would have been done with biking for another few months.  Go Felix!\n\n<p>\nAnother example of his self confidence is in using a computer.  He used to be bashful of his bad mouse skills and afraid of, well, doing pretty much anything on the computer.  This week we played an eductational computer game we hadn't tried in four months and he knocked it out of the park!  His mousing improved by the minute, and on the pre-reading parts he was even starting to recognize the letters that words start with. Whereas before Dean couldn't get Felix to keep using the mouse and play the game himself, this time Dean couldn't get a helping finger on the mouse -- Felix wanted to figure it out all by himself.  A fantastic change.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo's been in full athletics mode: always jumping, bouncing balls, and playing soccer. He actually plays soccer with a school friend, Finn.  They run around together dribbling.  It wasn't so long ago that he was still dribbling from the other end...\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"para\">\nDean thinks he has gray hair.  Just a bit, near the temples.  Lucie doesn't see it.  Dean thinks she's in denial.\n</p>",

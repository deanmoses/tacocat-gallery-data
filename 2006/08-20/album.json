    "description": "This weekend Felix moved out of his toddler bed, from which he was overflowing, into a deluxe apartment in the sky:  a bunk bed!  He's been lusting after such a bed for the longest time.  Felix has been consistently adamant that Milo shall get the bottom bunk, though he understands Milo is too young to leave the crib just yet. So sweet!  Actually, his wish may be granted pretty soon: lately when we've gone to retrieve Milo from the crib he's often had one leg over the top bar.\n<p>\nIn the last few months we have relied too much on TV to entertain Milo while fixing meals. Since he turned 2 we have decided No More TV in the morning, and rarely any TV in the evening. Milo is finally old enough to wait a bit for his food and (at least sometimes) old enough to play nicely by himself while we are busy in the kitchen. Now that TV is no longer a daily thing, Milo has pretty much forgotten that it exists -- he hasn't been begging for it nearly as much as he used to. Yay!\n</p>\nDean and Lucie went with 370 friends to see the premiere of <cite>Snakes on a Plane</cite>.  It was a fun time at an awful movie.  <a href=\"sods/index.html\">The pictures</a>.",

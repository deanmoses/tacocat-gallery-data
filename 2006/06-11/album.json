    "description": "Milo is on a blazing hot developmental streak.  Some highlights:\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px\">\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>Colors</u>:  Last week we thought he might know 'boo' and 'geen'.  Now we know he knows those and yellow and purple and red and others.  As always, he seems to learn the French and the English terms simultaneously and uses each one with the appropriate people.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>Numbers</u>:  Last week he suddenly started counting to 3, in both French and English.  This week he recited up to 11 in English, several times.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>Potty</u>:  Last week he started using the potty a bit, especially around bathtime.  This week he's blazing through potty training milestones:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Monday: First whole afternoon diaperless at home (peeing and pooping in the potty)</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Tuesday: First asking to get out of the bath to pee.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Wednesday: First pee in public bathroom.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Sunday: Learned to take down his pants himself.  Hasn't used it in a potty situation yet, but he was <i>so</i> proud of himself.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>Verbs</u>:  He started to use verbs, though not in sentences.  For example he'll sometimes say \"read\" instead of \"book\", or \"watch\" instead of \"tv\". \n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>Terrible Twos</u>:  He started the \"terrible twos\":  fiercely possessive of toys, using 'mine' and 'no' more often, and throwing tantrums when he doesn't get his way.  He's hitting it exactly when Felix did.  Felix's was very brief, maybe a few weeks.  Who knows with Milo -- they're so different!\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>Frisbee</u>:  He can throw a frisbee with a nice spin.  More than half the time it goes where he intends it.\n\t</li>\n</ul>",

If he can't get a laugh from singing a funny song at the table, he'll go for sticking food up his nose or pouring his water in his pasta.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo's entered a possessive stage.  He'll drape himself over Lucie and say, \"MY mommy.\"  Felix will very reasonably say, \"Of course not, Milo, she's my mommy too\". Felix is good about not being flustered by it, even though we get the feeling Milo's doing it in part to provoke a reaction. Also today he draped himself over the bumper of the car and said, \"MY car\", within earshot of Felix...\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"para\">\nAlso, see a few <a href=\"school_halloween/index.html\">pictures of Halloween at New School</a>.\n</p>",

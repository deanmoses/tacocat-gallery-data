Lucie is taking advantage of the break to potty train Milo. He was doing well last summer when the weather was warm enough to stroll the house naked, but never got the hang of wearing underwear. This Friday, the diaper came off. After a day of many accidents, a bribe was introduced: 3 M&M's for each potty use. Milo peed in the potty within 10 minutes. He is getting a little better every day, and always rushes proudly to get his yummy reward. \n</p>",

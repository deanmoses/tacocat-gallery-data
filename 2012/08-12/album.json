  "description": "We went to the dentist a few times over the last few weeks. Once for regular check-ups, then back to fix cavities and for an orthodontist consultation. <p>For the very first time, Milo had a cavity. They gave him nitrous oxide and he fell asleep while they worked on his tooth. Not too traumatic. </p><p>Felix has had many many cavities in his short life (12? 15? we lost count) but never on a permanent tooth so hopefully this means that his permanent teeth are made of better stuff than his baby teeth. The dentist expressed concerned that his X-ray showed that he might need braces soon. We were nervous going to the orthodontist consultation. Fortunately, the orthodontist declared that his X-ray is NOT cause for concerns. Felix does not need braces and it's unlikely he ever will. What a relief! Also, we learned that he only has 5 more baby teeth to loose. Wow! Milo has 16 more baby teeth to lose.</p>",

  "description": "At his 8-year old checkup, Milo tipped the scale at 61 pounds (27.5 kg) and measured 4 feet 4&frac14; inches (1m32). We are told he is in 80th percentile for height and the 50th percentile for weight. We believe he is in 99th percentile for cuteness but the doctor did not provide such a chart. <p>Speaking of growth, Felix continues to pack on weight at an astounding rate. He is now 104 pounds, or about 20 pounds (9kg) heavier than he was at his 10 year-old check-up 8 months ago. At this rate, he'll be heavier than Lucie by next summer! Already, his giant boy feet are bigger than hers.</p>",

The kids quickly fell into their new routines. They have a slew of after-school activities: Milo has guitar, soccer and theatre; Felix has karate and tutoring. We hired a college student to help with afternoon pick-up and the taxiing from one place to another. </p><p>Lucie's first day at her new job was a little rocky. She got stuck in traffic for hours because a police officer got shot and the highway closed down while she was on it.  Summer's most definitely over.</p>",

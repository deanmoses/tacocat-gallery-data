  "description": "Felix told Lucie: \"You know Mom, I'm not a kid anymore. I'm a pre-teen.\" Lucie tried to argue otherwise, but Felix is quite firm: \"From 10 to 12, you are a pre-teen.\" Alright then. <p>Friday after school, the 2nd grade families gathered at Cordonices park for an end-of-the-year picnic. Milo got a little too daring on the long concrete slide and scraped his face. He was fine until someone pointed out he was bleeding from the mouth, whereupon he instantly turned into a blubbering mess.  We left in a hurry. It was hours later that we realized where the blood had come from:  his front tooth got knocked out of his mouth! </p><p>It was a baby tooth and somewhat loose already, so no big deal.  Milo wrote a note to the tooth fairy to explain why the tooth is still at the park, complete with an illustration of the epic face plant.</p>",

    "description": "<P>\n<P>\n<p>\nFelix has grown a lot lately.  His feet have been leaders in this particular area.  I don't think even the Hulk's feet grow quite this fast.  At least Felix's aren't green.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe's become quite enamored of stuffed animals.  For most of his young life he couldn't have cared less about fuzzy furry soft toys.  He'd choose metal or plastic every time.  Lately though, he's been turning to his teddy bear Nounours and rag doll Martine for comfort and as sleepytime companions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSadly, the baby signs are steadily disappearing.   For example, he says \"fee\" for fish instead of his fish mouth sign.  It's sad because they were so cute!   He's still not pronouncing stuff very well, and it's in a mix of French and English, so people other than Dean and Lucie hardly understand a thing he says.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nDean turned 30.  He's said \"I'm 30\" once or twice, but it doesn't sound right yet.  By this point in life shouldn't he be wearing a watch or something?  Anyway, the Sun gave him a nasty birthday sunburn.  Thanks, Sun.  And he bruised his butt playing volleyball.  Maybe being 30 means getting injured when doing infrequent sporting activities.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

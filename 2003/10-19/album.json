In our sleep-deprived state, we just haven't gotten it together to put out last week's edition.\n\n<p>\nHave you been wondering what to get Felix for his birthday or Christmas?  It's easy -- pick from his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TSE04ZOF0WH9\">wishlist</a> on Amazon.com!\n</p>\n\n<p>\nGrandma Harriet was here for the weekend of the 11th.  Felix knew exactly who she was, her name (Nana), and gave her the biggest longest hug.  They got along like long lost buddies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTeeth:  his lower left molar came in, after a lot of painful teething.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe weekend of the 18th Dean visited his father in Terre Haute, Indiana.  <a href=\"terre_haute/index.htm\">Here's the pix</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

He also gestures furiously; some of it looks like baby signs he has made up, but we're not sure what they mean.\n\n<p>\nNew words:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t[<u>tap palm</u>]:  baby sign for \"again\" or \"more\". We have been trying to teach him this very useful sign for a couple of months. He finally got it today, and has put it to a LOT of use already.\n\t</li>\n\n\t<li>\n\t\t[<u>flap forearms</u>]: baby sign for \"bird\". He is still confused about where one species stops and the next one starts. When seeing an extravagant Carnival costume on TV, he flapped his arms and panted at the same time... a bird-dog?\n\t</li>\n\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>chaussette</u>: French for \"socks\". On Sunday morning, he took a pair of socks from his drawer and said a flawless \"chaussettes\", twice.\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>",

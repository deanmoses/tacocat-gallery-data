It was great.\n\n<p>\nFelix's phrases are getting longer, such as \"Want cookie!\" rather than just \"Cookie!\"   His answers are getting more sophisticated:  when asked who Jason was, he said \"Papa Evan\".\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe's getting better at identifying yellow things.   It seems like the next color he's going to get is orange.  Maybe that's appropriate for Thanksgiving:  yellow and orange are the colors of fall foliage.\n</p>",

    "description": "Felix has been a super kid lately.  He's been increasingly jolly, laughing and smiley.\n\n<p>\nA few weeks ago, he started being willfully disobedient and watching us to see how we'd respond.  We responded with \"time outs\", where we forcibly held him in a chair until he agreed to cooperate.   We only used them when he was being intentionally and provocatively disobedient.  We made sure we were consistent, and made sure we won each battle.  Happily, there ended up being only four battles:  now, just the threat of a timeout when he's trying to provoke us makes him cooperate, and quickly.   Each battle happened to be in a different room of the house:  it looks like he was figuring out if the rules varied geographically?  Anyway, he was a quick learner and if that's the end of it for us, we'll count ourselves extremely lucky.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSimilarly, we started actually brushing his teeth, rather than handing him a toothbrush and letting him lick the baby toothpaste off.   For a few days it was a strap-the-kid down torture procedure, but now he lets us get in there and scrub those pearly whites, and kind of enjoys it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the language side, his nouns are pretty bilingual, but his verbs are mostly English.  His favorite use of verbs is to boss us around.   Common verbs:  go, stop, stay, wait, see, open, help.  And he has the cutest \"Here you go!\" when he hands us stuff.\n</p>",

    "description": "<P>\n<P>\nMother's Day saw the Moses family visiting Grandma Harriet in Washington DC.   The five day trip was a great little vacation!  Lots of baby activities during the day, and lots of going out for Dean and Lucie in the evenings, while Felix hung out with Grandma.\n\n<p>\nNew words:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n[<u>hand to ear</u>]:  Music, sound.  Felix used this sign to decribe Grandma's stereo (and then displayed a lot of self-restraint by accepting NOT to play with all the tempting knobs). The next day, he used it in a mini sentence (hand to hear, then hands flapping) to tell us about the birds he could hear but not see in the park.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n<u>choo choo</u>:  Tram, like the railcars that go in front of our apartment.  He also used it in a sentence:  in the airport, Felix was pointing to the planes and flapping his arms (his bird sign).  When we boarded our plane, and he immediately got the point:  he flapped and said \"choo choo\".

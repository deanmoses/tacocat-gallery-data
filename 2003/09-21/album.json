    "description": "<P>\nFelix is revealing himself to be quite a pacifist. At a friend's BBQ there was a pi&ntilde;ata.  Unlike baby Nate, who banged the paper bird with gusto, Felix refused to partake in the beating of the pi&ntilde;ata, and looked to be quite anguished over the whole bizarre ritual. When the bird burst, Felix dissolved into tears. We reassembled it and made it dance a happy little birdy dance, but Felix kept mournfully chanting \"cass&eacute;, cass&eacute;\" (broken, broken). Similarly, Felix and Dean no longer play video games together because Felix gets too stressed.  He whimpers worried \"uh ohs\" when Dean drives the car on the sidewalk, and cries when the car goes up in flames.\n<p>\nFor the last week or so, Felix has been calling all big trucks \"pappay\", and we just could not figure out why. Then, one day, he yelled his most enthusiastic pappay to date, at the sight of a big shiny fire truck. It all became clear: he had been saying \"pompier\" all along, which means fireman in French (a fire truck is a \"camion de pompier\").\n\n\n<p>",

He's starting to use more and more sentences, and the structures are all English.  It makes sense:  only Lucie and Sylvie speak French, and Sylvie and Lucie only speak French when talking with him.  We're looking at French schools and language programs.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis longest sentence so far:  \"Watch Mommy, I'm going to jump!\"  And then he did.\n</p>\n  \n<p>\nHe'll remember what you said 20 mintues ago, like \"we're going to a toy store\", and hold you to it.  He knows what a toy store is and prefers it to a playground.  So far he isn't annoyingly acquisitive in stores:  he just likes going and playing with stuff.\n</p>",

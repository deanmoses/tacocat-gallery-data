Felix with his rumpled hair and shorts and sandals is looking a lot like Dean, which we find extremely cute.\n\n\n<p>\nThe top left canine has come in; the other three canines are sure to come barking along soon.  That leaves the last 4 molars to complete his baby teeth.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIt seems like he says something new every few hours, but only a few things have become repeated and predictable:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<u>da</u>:  dog.  The actual word for dog is slowly replacing the baby sign for dog (panting).\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n<u>beep beep</u>:  car horn.  He uses this when playing with toy cars.  \"Beep beep!\"\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSee this week's <a href=\"video/\">videos</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

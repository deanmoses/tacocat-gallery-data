    "description": "<P>\n<P>\nFelix's two bottom molars are coming in, painfully.  He's been grumpy and waking up very early.  But when he's not in a bad mood, he's been fascinating with his communication skills. He wants to know the name of everything, he asks \"dah? dah?\" all the time. Sometimes it actually sounds like \"what's that?\" or \"qu'est-ce que c'est, ca?\", tending to favor the English version.\n\n<p>\nNew words this week:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>boom</u>:  means something fell.  Usually because he threw it.  Lots of spoons and forks go boom in this family.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>uh-oh</u>:  means something's lost or unreachable.  Balls under the couch are definitely uh-oh.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>baby sign for food</u>:  we have a baby sign for food (touching your mouth).  He's starting to use it consistently.  Much nicer than having to guess if he's thirsty, teething, or tired.\n\t</li>\n</ul> \n</p>\n\n<p>",

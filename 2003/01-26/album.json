He <i>seems</i> to repeat words that we say:  tree, pear, isomorphic (not sure about that last one).  We're absoutely sure he knows \"come here\", even though he gives no indication of it.  I hear that this is such a hard concept that many kids never learn it.\n\n<p>   Dean and Lucie even got to go out on a date.  But that doesn't go on the website.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

    "description": "Felix's imagination is working flawlessly.   Sometimes it's hard to figure out whether he wants a drink of <i>real</i> water or <i>pretend</i> water.\n\n<p>\nHis comprehension has gotten good enough that we can read a fairly long story, like a Babar story book, and he'll sit still for it.  We think he gets most of it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix has never been one to imitate, but now he and Dean play an imitation game.  Dean will say \"ti ti\" (or some other simple sound) and Felix will repeat it.  Then Dean will say \"ta ta\" (changing either the consonant or vowel from the previous sound).   Felix will repeat that, and so on.   Simple but fun.  When Dean tries to mix up the first and second sound, like \"ta ti\", Felix gets it wildly wrong... so we're working up slowly to that game.\n</p>",

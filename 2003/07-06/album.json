            "description": "Dean's been tired of wearing glasses for a while, so Monday he got laser eye surgery.  So far it's been a success:  he has much better than 20/20 vision.   However, the vision can go back  down a little or even quite a bit at any time in the next half year, so send good wishes his way.\n\n<p>Dean took a very new form of laser surgery that was approved by the FDA only two weeks prior.  He was the second or third patient the doctor had done.  This new type of surgery programs the computer-guided laser with a much more detailed set of measurements than the previous type, which theoretically should give better vision than the regular type of surgery.  In Dean's case, the theory seems to have been correct.\n\n<p>The only drawbacks are his eyes are very sensitive to light for about a week (hence the sunglasses in the picture), and he must use eyedrops to keep his eyes extra moist <i>every hour</i> for the next <i>three months</i>.  Except when asleep.",

    "description": "<P>\n<P>\nThe Moses family celebrated America's independance from those tatty British chaps by going camping with about 100 friends.\n\n<p>Felix passed an important first:  we cut his fingernails without crying or hysterics!  Dean and Felix were watching Blue's Clues, which was talking about rulers.  We also had a ruler in our hands.  Felix was so taken by the whole ruler concept that he forgot to complain about Lucie cutting his nails.  It took about 45 seconds instead of the usual 5 minutes.\n\n<p>Felix can say or sign about 50 words.  He's got the idea that his own language is somewhat different than mom's or dad's:  we can ask him \"What's the sign for elephant?\" and he'll respond with a hand waving in front of his nose.  If we ask him \"What's the sign for bird?\", he'll respond \"ack ack ack\".   However, some words are the same:  if we ask him \"What's the sign for papa?\", he'll respond \"papa\".\n\n<p>He said his first spoken sentence:  \"more lala\", meaning turn the TV back on.  Also, words are getting more distinct:  boat is now always \"bateau\":  he's dropped \"bo\" and \"babeau\".\n\n<p>\nNew words:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t[<u>two fingers to eye</u>]: camera.  He made it up himself.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t[<u>one finger to eye</u>]: eyedrops.  He made it up himself.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>noo-noo</u>: Nounours.  Nounours means \"teddy bear\" in French.  We have a specific teddy bear called Nounours, but Felix calls all cuddly stuffed animals \"noo-noo\".\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>Nay</u>: Nathaniel.  He knows his friend!\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>Zeekay</u>: Ezekiel.  Ezekiel calls Felix \"Eeks\".\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>",

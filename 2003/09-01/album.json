    "description": "<P>\n<P>\nThe Moses and Joyce families celebrated Labor Day by visiting the animals at the San Francisco zoo, followed by supper at the Joyces.  A fine time was had by all.  Felix loves the Joyce house because of all the toys and fish and cat and children and convivial commotion.  He got chocolate-drunk on the pudding that Amanda made, which is okay because it turns out he's a happy -- not angry -- sort of drunk. \n\n<p>\nThe Moses house is no longer entirely Felix-proof because he hauls footstools and pushcarts and other astonishingly heavy objects onto the furniture, which lets him get even higher.  \n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix can hang by hands for a few seconds, no feet on the floor.  This comes in handy when he uses a pushcart to get to a high shelf, then the pushcart wheels out from under him.  He can hang by his fingertips for a second or two until we get him down.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe're taking the unusual step of putting photos up two days in a row because of the lack of photos for the previous two weeks.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>",

We can't say this was the most merry Christmas ever, but at least <i>most</i> of the barfing was done on things that don't stain.\n\n<p>\nHe's mostly over it.  He's eating and no longer has a fever.  Now he just has a cough and sniffles, is grumpy, and feels entitled to a bunch of sick-time privileges like too much television and sleeping in our bed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAbout 40% of Felix's talking is in sentences rather than single words.   Things like \"cookie\" have become \"want cookie!\"  The verbs and sentence structure are all English, but some of the nouns are French.\n</p>",

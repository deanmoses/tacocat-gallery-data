Lots of people said it was what they were looking for.  One more open house next Sunday.  Wish us luck.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tLucie turned 30.  We celebrated by failing to find a babysitter, replacing burnt out lightbulbs in Holly Park, eating take out sushi, then collapsing into bed.  Felix and Dean owe Lucie a party, big time.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tFelix has said many words:  \"Babar\" (the French cartoon elephant), \"boo\" (peekaboo), \"meow\" (sound the cat makes), \"papa\", \"mama\", and a few more.  The only one he says by himself (without us saying it first) is \"boo\", when he plays peekaboo.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tWe warm up his bottle by microwaving it for one minute.  We count down the last five seconds.  He shakes his finger on each number with us.  Of course, now he tries shaking his finger for the other 55 seconds too, in the hopes of speeding it up.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tHe eats his yogurt with a spoon, by himself.  We've been able to start reading the morning newspaper again.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tHe's started going to sleep at night by himself, in his crib, rather than having to be rocked in our arms.  The nighttime rocking-to-sleep was nice and cuddly, but the new routine is certainly more convenient for us.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tHe dances!  When music is on, he moves in gentle lopsided spiral, like a leaf going down a drain.\n\t</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nHe's been an adorable, charming, rapidly developing little boy.\n\n<p>",

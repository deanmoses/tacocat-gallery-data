    "description": "<P>\n<P>\nFelix was sick early in the week.  Midweek, he went to the pediatrician and got the standard 18-month shots, which can leave a baby feeling under the weather.  Two canines broke through the gum (lower right and upper right) by the weekend. So Felix had an excuse to be in a bad mood this week.  And he was, the little snot.  Consequently, we didn't take many pictures.\n<p>\nHis saving grace this week is that he's just so damn cute.\n\n<p>\nHe weighs 26 lbs 8 oz (12 kg) and is 33 3/4 inches (86 cm) tall.\n\n<p>\nNew words this week:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n[<u>palms opening and closing</u>]:  book.  He likes to sit in the leather armchair and ask us to fetch him books.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n<u>mooooo</u>:  answer to the question \"what sound does the cow make?\"\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>",

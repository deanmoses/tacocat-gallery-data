    "description": "<P>\n<P>\nFelix continues to enchant us with his language exploration. More and more, he wants to tell us about things just for the sake of conversation, instead of for expressing a need. On Wednesday, on the way back from our weekly swimming-pool session, Felix babbled with enthusiasm on the back seat, incorporating swimming-related signs (\"water\", \"fish\", and hand motions to the song we sing at the pool).\n\n\n<p>\nNew words:\n<ul>\n\t<li> <u>ack ack ack [+ flapping hand]</u> Bird. This started as \"quack quack\", the sound the duck makes. Now, Felix has coupled it with his sign for bird (flapping hand), and he's been very busy spotting birds everywhere.\n\t<li>\n\t\t<u>bo</u>: Bottle. When Felix really wants a bottle, he does the food sign (fingers to mouth), takes us to the microwave, and shakes his hand like he is counting down. If we still don't make him a bottle, he asks for \"bo! bo! bo!\"\n\t</li>\n\t<li> \t<u>ba</u>: Ball. Felix is such a big fan of the \"ba\" sound, it's hard to be sure when he means it as a word. Babar and bubble (both pronounced\"baba\", more or less) have disappeared from his vocabulary; however, he does seem to say \"ba\" even more than usual when a ball is around.\n\t</li>\n</ul> \n\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nSee this week's <a href=\"video/\">video</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

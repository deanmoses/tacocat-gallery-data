More is \"more\", \"(en)'core\" or fingers tapping palm.\n<p>\nAll dogs are now \"Georgie\", the dog at Sylvie's.\n<p>\nHe calls Lucie's shoes \"chaussures\" and Dean's shoes \"shoes\".\n<p>\nAll muppet-like animals are \"melmo\", meaning Elmo.\n<p>\nFelix's favorite TV show is Blue's Clues, which he asks for by name: \"boos coos\".\n<p>\nFirst 3 syllable word: \"abricot\" (apricot, in French)\n\n<p>",

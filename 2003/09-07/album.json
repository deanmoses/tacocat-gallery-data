    "description": "Felix has been getting a whole lotta love:  <i>both</i> grandmas are in town.\n\n<p>\nMental development is speeding up.  He suprises us every few hours with something new.  Just today he figured out how his train cars are magnetized such that if one end doesn't attach, turn it around and use the other end.  Also today he asked Austin (who was looking under the sofa for a toy), \"What are you doing?\"  Perfect grammar, perfect pronunciation, perfect inflection.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThey say at this stage they pick up one new word every half hour.  That's easy to believe.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOver the last few weeks he's started to test boundaries.  He'll continue to do something after we've said stop, just to see what happens.  He's a pretty rules-oriented person, though, so it hasn't been nearly as bad as many other kids his age.  He'll sometimes throw a great screaming tantrum if he doesn't get his way, but it seems sort of experiemental -- he'll usually stop the tantrum quickly if it isn't helping his cause.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis lower left molar has broken the surface.  Three more teeth, and he'll have the full set.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

    "description": "<P>\n<P>\nThe Moses family has moved!  We've rented a flat in the Castro district, and are selling our house.  This coming week painters are fixing up Holly Park.  Next Sunday is the first open house, to show it to potential buyers.\n\n<p>\nHouse prices are going down in San Francisco:  we're aiming to lock in a profit from our house, and see about buying again in a year or so.  In the meantime, we're renting a bigger place, and trying a different area of the city.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nAlmost everyone has said to us, <i>\"How could you leave that adorable little house on Holly Park?\"</i>  It was easy:  we wanted more space, and we wanted to move closer to city life.  We loved our four years there, but with Felix, the place was getting smaller by the week.  Time to move on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe new place is great:  not quite as charming as Holly Park, but cute enough and very easy to live in.   Everything we need is within two blocks:  the big grocery store, the gourmet grocery store, the gym, the tram to work, at least thirty restaurants.  There's three great playgrounds within 7 blocks.  We may never drive the car again, which is good, because it's kind of scary to back the car out of the new garage.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

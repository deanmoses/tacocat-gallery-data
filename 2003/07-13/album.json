He's undergone a language explosion, and can get a concept or word if you repeat it once or twice.  We can no longer keep track of what he can say.  Some of his new ones he uses all the time, like \"ka\" for car and \"fu\" for phone, \"po\" for pomme/poire (apple/pear), \"abo\" for apricot.  He makes the most adorable singsong clucking sound to mean a clock.  And if you ask him what sound a cow makes, he'll tilt his head back and give you the most soulful \"moo\" you've ever heard.\n\n<p>",

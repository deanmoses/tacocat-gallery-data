    "description": "<P>\n<P>\nOn his 21 month birthday, Felix peed in the potty for the first time... big boy stuff!  He's done it once at Syvie's and once at home.   But we're still a long way from being housebroken.\n\n<p>\nHis incoming molars are painful, which has given him a short fuse most of the week.  Many days any little thing set off a tantrum, but they were usually short. He particularly hates getting dressed, because he wants to continue his potty-training.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe thought we'd give a retrospective of his most-used vocabulary in honor of him turning 21:\n<ul>\n<li><u>yeah, no, more/encore/[fingers tapping palm], up, down</u>: the basics.\n\n<li><u>choo-train, car, plane, caco (bike), boat/bateau</u>: Felix loves his vehicles. Bateau also means the ocean or the beach.\n\n<li><u>foo(d), cookie, (ba)nana, pomme (apple,or any round fruit), r(ais)in, pain (bread), chee(se), jus (juice), [hands rubbing] (water), bo(ttle)/[counting down motion]</u>: Felix loves his food.\n\n<li><u>Papa, Mommy, Sylvie</u>: Felix loves his people\n\n<li><u>dog/doggie/georgie, chat/cat, [clicking noise] (horse), ack ack ack (bird), du(ck), turtle, (ele)phant/[hand to nose], (dol)fin, fish/[mouth opening and closing], ssssssssss (snake), fly (any insect), frog/[toungue darting in and out],[touching neck] (giraffe)</u>: Felix loves his animals\n\n<li><u>[palms closing and opening] (book), lala (TV), pho(ne), [hand to ear] (noise, music), key, [clicking noise] (clock), nounou (teddy bear), b&eacute;b&eacute;, main (hand), shoe, [hand tapping head] (hat, or shower, depending on context), bain (bath), [finger rubbing gum] (toothbrush), pipi, caca, outside/dehors, ball, bubbles, fleur (flower), dodo (sleep), bye-bye</u>: Felix has a wide range of interests\n\n<li><u>cass&eacute;</u>: broken, in French. This is a new word. Felix very much notices when one of his toys is broken. A banana with a piece broken off is also cass&eacute;\n\n<li><u>mine</u>: this one is not so endearing. Felix has always been possessive, but it has taken a turn for the worse. Evan came over to our house one afternoon, and Felix screamed the whole time, yelling \"mine\" at anything that Evan touched. He is fine with sharing on neutral ground, but home is sacred.\n\n<li><u>[fist rubbing eye]</u> crying. Whenever Felix spots another child crying, he wants to know why.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

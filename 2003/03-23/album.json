    "description": "<P>\n<P>\nLucie started a new job.  It's a 6 week contract working at Classroom Connect.   It's 4 days a week, so Nanny Sylvie is taking Felix four days now, instead of two.   Felix hasn't had a hard time adjusting -- he cries when he sees Lucie leave, but he stops as soon as Sylvie's door is closed.   It's the first job that Lucie's ever driven to (only 15 minutes though).\n\n<p>\nSaturday we had a housewarming party / birthday party for Lucie.  Lots of old friends came.  We had a great time.  Felix spent the night at Sylvie's, making it a very nanny-intensive week.  But apparently <i>he</i> had a great time too, staying up two and a half hours past his bedtime, listening to Sylvie's friends play the piano.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis favorite dessert is strawberries & cream:  he uses the strawberry as a spoon, licks the cream off of it, then goes back for another scoop of cream.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNew word:\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t[<u>rub palms</u>]:  rubbing the palms together is the baby sign for running water, like water coming out of a faucet.\n\t</li>\n</ul> \n</p>\n\n<p>",

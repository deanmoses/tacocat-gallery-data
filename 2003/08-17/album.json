    "description": "<P>\n<P>\nFelix's monkey ancestors made their genes felt this week.  He's had a sudden attack of dexterity.  He can climb up (some) slides, climb up the back stairs of our house without crawling, and today he suddenly appeared on top of the kitchen table.\n\n<p>\nHe says \"papa\" a lot, which makes Dean happy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe can be very deliberate with his communication.  When he wants something and feels we're not paying attention, he'll say \"papa\" or \"mama\", wait until we have eye contact, then tell us what he wants.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe makes up his own words and uses them consistently, even when we don't understand.  \"Caco\" means a bike or motorcycle, but it took several days of him going \"caco caco caco\" like a maniac before we figured it out.  Another favorite is \"ayzho\". He's been saying it for days.  We have no idea what it means.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSee this week's <a href=\"video\">videos</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

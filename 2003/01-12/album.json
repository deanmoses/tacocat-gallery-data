Paris was cold cold cold.\n<p>\nFelix's babbling has been very word-like for a while, and now some of it is sounding real. \"ma ma ma\" does seem to refer specifically to Lucie. Felix's vocabulary clearly has an all-purpose negative, \"nan\" (sort of between the English No and the French Non), and an all-purpose affirmative \"yeah\" or \"ouai\" (sort of between a Yes and a Oui). The first true clear word emerged this week; it's \"regarde\".\n<p>\nSeveral times this week, Felix pointed at something noteworthy and exclaimed \"Regarde!\" (\"look!\"). The first time was at La Tour d'Aigues, on an early morning stroll to get croissants (he had spotted a cat running through the deserted street). Beside Lucie, several other folks (Francoise, Lou, Michele), unprompted, confirmed that Felix does indeed say \"regarde\". The boy speaks French!\n\n<p>",

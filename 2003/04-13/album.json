    "description": "<P>\n<P>\nGrandma Harriet was here for the weekend.  She and the little man of the house hit it off, as always.  The Moses family's social life pales in comparison to hers:  baseball and basketball games, a book club, trips to New York, tennis, concerts, ad nauseum.  And that's in just one week.\n\n\n<p>\nFelix seems much older and more intelligent, just in the last few days.  He seems to understand a large part of what we say to him, though getting him to act on it is another matter (he still doesn't respond to \"come here\" at   all).  He's making up baby signs that we haven't figured out what they mean.  For the first time tonight he did the hand gestures that go with the song \"Wheels on the Bus\".\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLanguage is still funny and weird.  Out of the blue, he'll repeat a word perfectly -- like \"rain\" -- but then never say it again.  The baby sign for cat has disappeared, replaced by the sign for dog.   Dog ate cat.   All cats and other animals are dogs.  He's starting to get intonations correct -- he makes sounds like he's counting 1-2-3, but he's not using any number system we've ever heard of.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

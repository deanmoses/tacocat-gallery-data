    "description": "Felix had an amazing first: he told us about his day! At bedtime he was curled up in Lucie's lap and, per our usual ritual, she was giving him a bottle and telling him about his day. Usually, he just drinks quietly. This time, it went something like this:\n<ul>\n\t<li><u>Lucie</u>:  Tu as pass&eacute; une bonne journ&eacute;e? (<i>did you have a good day?</i>)\n\t<li><u>Felix</u>:  Bateau (<i>boat</i>)\n\t<li><u>Lucie</u>:  Oui! Sylvie m'a dit! Vous avez vu des bateaux &agrave; la plage, aujourd'hui! Qui est-ce qu'il y avait, avec toi et Sylvie? (<i>Yes! Sylvie told me! You saw boats at the beach today! Who else was with you and Sylvie?</i>)\n\t<li><u>Felix</u>:  Van (<i>Evan</i>)\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nLucie tried to ask more questions, but he was done. Still, pretty amazing! For months now, all we know about his day with Sylvie is what Sylvie tells us. It feels great that soon he will be able to tell us for himself what goes on when we are apart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix started saying \"thanks\", not every time you give him something, just when he really means it.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix has well assimilated that kisses make boo-boos better. He has a small scab on his left foot that he has made us kiss many, many times in the last 10 days. Also, whenever he hurts us (for example, elbows us by accident), we point it out to him, and he always dutifully kisses the wound. It's funny, because he rarely agrees to give us a kiss when we ask for one just for the sake of a kiss. Are we going to have to fake boo-boos to get our daily allowance of kisses?\n</p>\n\n<p>",

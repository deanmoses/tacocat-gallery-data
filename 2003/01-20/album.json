Everytime he is introduced to one of his old routine (his room, the local playground, his nanny, the grocery store, the swimming pool...), he is positively beaming.\n<p>\nJet lag, however, is proving quite painful. Felix is very very sleepy in the afternoon, and he wakes up in the middle of the night. Also, he is forgotten how to fall asleep by himself. We are all feeling a little sleep-deprived, but things are slowly getting better.\n<p>",

Since it had been 2 years since their last visit, you'd think we'd have taken a commemorative photo but you would be thinking wrong. Somehow, we forgot. Are we losing our touch?<p>Anyway, it was very nice to see them.  The kids were delighted make their re-acquaintance (they didn't really remember them from last time). We went on a family trip to the Walt Disney Family Museum in the Presidio in San Francisco.</p>",

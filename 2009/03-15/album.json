  "description": "The big news of the week is that the wildlife center rescued another squirrel and placed him in our foster care.   We christened him Busta.  He and Luke like to snuggle.  Luke's a little sick, and the Squirrel Lady rushed over an ice chest of improved formula.  She got dedication.<p>Felix continues his steady march towards reading full, real books.  We keep a stock of Dr. Seuss in the car and he'll read a few pages before his brain overheats.  It's strange how he never guesses at a word or uses the pictures to help figure it out.  So far, except for a handful of sight words, he has to fully and consciously remember and apply all the rules of the language.  Nothing's coming free or easy to him.  Despite that he's got a fantastic attitude and doesn't get discouraged.  Go Felix!</p><p>Milo, on the other hand, is getting it free and easy.  He's also reading, somewhat close to the level Felix is.  He just busted out and started reading Dr. Seuss books.  We're pretty sure he's not memorizing it.  You tell us, by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUPP6gjo53Q\">watching this video of him reading HOP on POP</a>.</p>",

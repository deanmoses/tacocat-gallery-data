  "description": "Here's how the family's doing this week:<p><strong style=\"font-size:larger\">Felix</strong> lost toof number six.  And he finally won his battle against a virus that's lasted two whole weeks.  He had no appetite and lost a ton of weight, enough that his pants were slipping down.  But now he's eating like a <em>cochon</em> again.</p><p><strong style=\"font-size:larger\">Milo</strong> has developed a deep, deep addiction to Spore (the video game Lucie's working for).  We only let him play a little bit each day but he seems to prefer it to any other activity in the world right now.  He's doing some very sophisticated things in it that take strategy and planning, so we guess it's educational on some level.  However, we're suspicious of hooking him up to the computer at such an early age.  We're developing a plan to wean him off.</p><p><strong style=\"font-size:larger\">Dean</strong>'s company HOT or NOT launched an iPhone version of their website and it's in the top 5 social networking apps on iTunes.  Woo!</p><p><strong style=\"font-size:larger\">Lucie</strong> had a lot of fun making icons for an upcoming suite of new Spore superpowers.  Go <cite>Cosmic Blast<cite>!</cite></cite></p><p><strong style=\"font-size:larger\">Our good camera</strong> is in the shop with a \"broken shutter magnet\".   Poor thing.   This week's photos were all taken with Lucie's iPhone.</p>",

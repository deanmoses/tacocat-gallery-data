  "description": "Last year, Lucie trained at the <a href=\"http://yuwr.org/\">Yggdrasil Urban Wildlife Rescue Center</a> to be a foster care-giver for orphaned baby squirrels. This week, we reported for duty and took in a tiny baby squirrel whose nest fell from a tree during a storm. The mom fled but some people found the little guy and alerted the rescue center. After a few days under observation at the center (the good samaritans had fed him Half and Half -- a big No No), he was placed into our home. <p>We named him Luke.  Luke will stay with us until he is old enough to be released in the wild (3 months or so).</p>",

Instead, he hung out at home while Dean and Lucie took turn working from home. Thankfully, we managed to line up daily playdates with friends who were still in town and didn't have camp. </p><p>Things will get easier starting next week: Milo's upcoming camps are not as athletic and he has a real cast since Friday. It feels much sturdier and play-proof than his temporary splint.</p>",

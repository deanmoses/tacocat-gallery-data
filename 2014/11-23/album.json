  "description": "Lucie is very excited to be sewing one brown stripe on her green Cuong Nhu belt. It had been about 18 months since her last belt test. <p>To attend a belt test at our dojo, you have to wait until Sensei John invites you. He is the one who decides whether you are ready to move up to the next level. Because of that rule, you are pretty much sure you will succeed at your belt test unless you really make a mess of it. Still, there is something nerve racking about taking a test, no matter the odds.</p>",

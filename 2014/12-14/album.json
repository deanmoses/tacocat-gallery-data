  "description": "The day Felix turned into a teenager had panache and dramatic flair. The entire Bay Area declared a state of emergency. Schools were closed for the day. Office workers were urged to work from home.<p>All the <em>sturm und drang</em> was not, however, because of one boy's ascent into teenagerdom.  We had the Storm of the Decade!</p> <p>If you watched the news, the worst storm in recent history wreaked havoc with roads and caused mud slides. From where WE stood, it was downright cozy. Everybody was at home, either working or playing.  We spent the day indoors listening to the rain pelt the windows. Felix slowly opened his presents from breakfast to evening. Lucie took breaks from work to cook yummy birthday-worthy desserts. </p><p>The best part was that we hadn't been expecting to spend the day together. The storm felt like a gift from the skies to celebrate our birthday boy.</p>",

  "description": "On a Friday afternoon, we were surprised to receive the following email from the school:<blockquote><i><p>Dear Parents, </p><p>This morning I learned that some of your children are Pastafarian (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster\">see Wikipedia</a>), which is not a major problem except that some of them have been trying to convince children who believe in God that God doesn't exist.  That brought some stress for a couple of girls.  This morning I met with your children and we had a conversation on beliefs, traditions, heredity, respect and discrimination.  I would appreciate if you could have a follow-up at home concerning the fact that everybody has the right to believe in whatever they want as long as they also respect others' beliefs.  Thank you for your cooperation.  On Monday Thierry and I we'll reconvene with your children in order to bring closure to this issue. </p><p>Have a good week-end.</p></i></blockquote><p>We assured the school counselor we would remind Milo that the great Flying Spaghetti Monster teaches tolerance toward other religions.</p>",

They did it all. With the instructor's help, they wrote the plot, painted the background, created the characters out of clay, filmed the animation frame by frame and did the voice-over for the soundtrack. The studio took care of the final production.

    "description": "Felix turned 2 1/2, the new baby is a month away, and Nana came for a visit.\n<p>\nFelix explores concepts through pretend play to a degree we don't see in other kids his age.  One of the concepts he's exploring right now is fear.  He's trying out different fears, like fear of ants and fear of falling off a bicycle.   Some are purely playful, like his fear of crabs where he wants Dean to be a crab and chase him into the safely of Lucie's arms.   Others, like the bike, have some degree of reality, but he wants to play it up rather than conquer it.   When Dean actually gets him into the baby seat on his bike, he loves it.  It's fascinating.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn another imagination-related point, Felix hijacked tonight's bedtime story.  Dean was making up a story about sleeping on a boat.  Felix started inserting stuff into the story:  fish sleeping in beds, airplanes overhead, and some sort of hole that was getting rained on by a storm.\n</p>",

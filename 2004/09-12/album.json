    "description": "</TD>\n</TR>\n</TABLE>\n<P>\n<P>\nMilo smiled his first smile this week, and Dean and Felix went to Natchez.\n\n<p>\nFelix's language acquisition keeps taking interesting turns: \n<ul>\n\t<li>\nHe's occasionally putting the diminutive \"-ie\" on the end of many words that don't really take it.  A shoe might go on his \"footie\" and we could float a \"boatie\" in the bathtub.  \t\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\nIn the space of a minute, in a conversation migrating from Enlish to French, he used the term \"fireman\" then \"fire monsieur\" then \"pompier\".\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\nEven though he's never explicitly mentioned French or English, he's asked Dean to sing bedtime songs in Spanish.  Fortunately Dean knows \"Happy Birthday\" and a Christmas carol in Spanish, and Felix seems content with those.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\nHe's exploring the concept of \"never been there/done that\".  When told that a plane was arriving from far away towns like Atlanta and Memphis, he solemnly says each time, \"I NEVER been here!\" (Meaning there.)  He's taking it too far, though:  he tried to tell Dean that \"I NEVER read that!\" to a book that Dean already read 8 times that day.\n\t</li>\n\n</ul>\n</p>",

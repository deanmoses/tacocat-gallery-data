    "description": "Felix is now a three year old!  By our recollection, just a few days ago he was a helpless lump.  Now he's a fine upstanding boy -- happy, polite -- with a vivid imagination and a love of books.  He's living a thoughtful life:  lots of empathy for others, thinking a lot about friendship and what it means to have and keep friends, and always wondering about how others view the world.  One of his favorite mechanisms to explore the motives of others is to ask Dean or Lucie what a person or animal or a character in a book is saying, even if they aren't saying anything.  For example, when we're pretend fishing, he'll ask, \"What fish in bucket say?\" to explore whether the fish likes being in the bucket or not.  Our answers are either honest or funny or both:  \"Ooo!  Let me out of this bucket!  I want to go swim!  I don't want to be eaten!\"\n\n<p>\nWe couldn't be happier with the way he's turning out.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo, cute as he is, is still a helpless lump.  On Felix's birthday, we gave Milo the gift of solid food.\n</p>",

    "description": "<P>\nNana was in town this weekend.  She and Felix really enjoyed hanging out.   And Dean and Lucie really enjoyed going out.   Lucie's birthday was Friday the 20th; we went with friends to a club and shot pool, something we haven't done in quite a while.\n\n<p>\nFelix is getting more high-energy.  He jumps around more, makes more loud noises, wrestles Dean with more ferocity and tenacity, and gets more bruises from falling and knocking into things.  He's good about brushing off a fall and getting back to what he was doing.  Now when people ask \"how's your baby?\", it's hard to connect it with Felix.  Felix is a little boy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the language front, he says \"sorry\" and \"cool!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the discipline front, on the very infrequent occasions we give him a time out, he has the self restraint to sit in the chair himself (with one of us watching) rather than having to be held there.\n</p>",

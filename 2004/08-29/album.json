    "description": "Milo, like many babies his age, is fairly fussy.  He's increasingly aware but has absolutely no idea what to do with it.  So he cries a lot of the time he's awake.\n\n<p>\nWe're pretty relaxed about it -- compared to Felix's first two months, Milo is still a breeze.  We're really impressed by how well Felix is handling it.   He's certainly not getting as much quality time with Mom and Dad because of fussy Milo, but he's shown no sign of holding it against the little critter.  They still talk a lot (Milo's voice usually provided by Mom), and Felix is very gentle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix is still very attached to Dean.  He still sometimes claims that Dean is <i>his</i> papa, not Milo's.   Dean coming home after work is a joyful affair with lots of hugs and kisses.\n</p>",

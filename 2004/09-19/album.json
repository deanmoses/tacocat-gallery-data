    "description": "</TD>\n</TR>\n</TABLE>\n<P>\n<P>\n<p>Milo loves to suck, but usually refuses bottles and pacifiers.  His motto: \"flesh is best\".  Lucie's trying to train him to take the bottle reliably so she can be away from him longer than 3 hours.\n\n<p>The following exchange shows a lot about the state of Felix's language, and the fact that he often remembers who gave him what toy.  \n<br><u>Felix</u>:  That's my nouveau tow truck.\n<br><u>Lucie</u>:  C'est ta d&eacute;paneuse?  <i>[That's your tow truck?]</i>\n<br><u>Felix</u>:  Nana (a)ch&egrave;te me petite (d&eacute;)paneuse at frite store. <i>[Nana bought me a little tow truck at McDonald's.]</i>\n\n<p>Felix is starting to confront the idea that everybody grows up.  He doesn't like it.  Everytime we talk about it, he says he doesn't want to be a big person, which I think is a pretty sane position to hold.   One night he woke up crying and that was the first thing out of his mouth.   We don't force the issue:  we tell him he can stay a boy.  \n\n<p>Also, Felix has revealed to us the truth about Felix the Cat.  It's actually Felix, disguised as a cat.  He's very firm about this:  \"That's me, (de)guis&eacute; chat.\"",

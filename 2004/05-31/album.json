Bastille had the hiccups for the first time.\n<p>\nThis week, a couple of times, Felix asked to have his pants and diaper taken off, so he could pee in the potty (and he did, successfully). He has used the potty a few times before, but always when he happened to be naked and in close proximity of a potty (at bath time, or while playing in the nude in the garden). We are pretty sure this recent turn of event has something to do with seeing other kids use the toilet at preschool.\n<p>\nWe are feeling smug about living in Berkeley. San Francisco is starting to get its summer cool weather, whereas we are enjoying the East Bay sun.\n</p>",

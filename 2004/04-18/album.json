We've had fun drawing <a href=\"move/index.htm\">pictures of the move</a>.\n\n<p>\nMentally, we're saying goodbye to our daily routine in San Francisco.  Every time we do something, we wonder if it's the last time.  Having coffee and juice at Maxfield's.   Shopping at the local fruit market.   Dropping Felix off at Evan's for the evening, and vice versa.  Bumping into friends on the street.   Hopping in the streetcar to go downtown.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJudging from the strollers littering the porches in our new neighborhood, and the strong community feel, we won't have any problem making friends.  It's just hard leaving the old ones behind.  It's not like we won't ever see them, but they won't be a part of our daily lives.\n</p>",

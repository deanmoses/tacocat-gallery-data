    "description": "</TD>\n</TR>\n</TABLE>\n<P>\n<P>\nMilo is getting bigger and taller fast. He has outgrown most of his \"0 to 3 months\" outfits; and his cheeks are getting chubbier.\n\n<p>\nIt's been very hot in the Bay Area. One day this week, we did an outing to Lake Anza. Felix was playing in the water, wearing a swimsuit and no diaper. He surprised Lucie by asking to go to the restroom. Once there, he actually peed in the big people toilet. Suspicious, Lucie asked him where he pees at shool, in his diaper or in the toilet? Felix confessed that he pees in the toilet at school; though he prefers the diaper at home. What's a parent to do? At this point, we suspect he would quickly get toilet-trained if we stopped putting diapers on him, but WE are not quite ready to deal with the inevitable accidents, while caring for an infant. \n</p>",

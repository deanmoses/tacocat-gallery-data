He carefuly put the elephant in a sieve, wrapped in a napkin, on the floor. Several times during lunch, Felix excused himself from the table, claiming that his baby was crying. He would gently pet it for a minute or two. I asked him why his baby was crying, and he just sort of shrugged, as if to say \"well, you know, that's what babies do\". \n<p>\nFor a 2-year old, he's got a remarkably realistic expectation of what life with an infant is like.",

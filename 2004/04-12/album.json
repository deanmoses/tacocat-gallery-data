Most of all, he likes Mom and Dad to draw pictures of planes landing airports and letting passengers out.\n\n<p>\nThe drawings below are Dean and Lucie originals, drawn on the back of Scrabble scoresheets, to distract Felix while attempting to finish a Scrabble game after Felix woke up prematurely from his nap.  While fairly decent representatives of the genre, they aren't anything that we haven't drawn a hundred times before.\n</p>",

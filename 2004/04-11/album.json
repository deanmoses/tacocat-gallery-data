    "description": "<img align=\"left\" src=\"happy_easter.gif\" />\n\nThe weekend was spent doing pleasant Eastery things.  Felix didn't really understand any of the holiday, or the connection between bunnies and eggs, but he caught on to egg painting and egg finding real quick.\n\n<p>\nWe made an offer on a house in Berkeley.  It was accepted.  Assuming nothing goes wrong, we'll be moving in three or four weeks.  It's a great house in a great neighborhood.  See the <a href=\"../08/index.htm\">new house pictures</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe've already started looking for daycare/preschool in the East Bay.  We visited one place with Felix, who had a great time.  Didn't want to leave, in fact.  But once we got him back in the car we asked him if he had liked it, and he said, \"Nooo! Want stay Sylvie!\"  The kid really gets what's going on.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nNeed some artwork for your corporate headquarters?

    "description": "Days 4 & 5 of Milo.  So far, Milo's been as good as we could have possibly asked for.  He's sleeping three or even  four hours at a time, and at night he usually goes right back to sleep after feeding.  He's eating great.  There's none of the nursing problems that we had with Felix.  Amazingly, we actually feel rested and in control.\n\n<p>\nNana's been taking care of everything that needs to be taken care of -- cooking, washing, Felix-sitting, Milo-sitting, you name it.   She's made it a really easy few days for us.  Thanks, Nana!\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix is doing well, although he's had a few meltdowns and is extra extra attached to Dean.  These indicate that he's anxious about what changes Milo is going to bring.  We've been making sure he gets a whole lotta lovin', as these pictures show.  He already seems to be getting better as he sees that both Mom and Dad are still around, and still have time to play with him.\n</p>",

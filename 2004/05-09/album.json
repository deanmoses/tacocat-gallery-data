Nana was there  to help, which was good, because Felix managed to get his very first ear infection the morning of the move.  He was very sick the whole day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe haven't met many of the neighbors yet, but the ones we have are nice.  There's an 8-ish year old boy living behind us, who took great interest in the move.  Anna, next door, collects planes.  Felix is fascinated by the one on her porch, made out of beer cans.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs of Sunday night, barely 24 hours after the moving truck left, the house is livable.  There are tables, chairs, and couches at all the right places.  The kitchen is all there.   And Felix has already created an airport in his room.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHome ownership hit with a vengeance:  we already have a leaking toilet and water heater to fix.\n</p>",

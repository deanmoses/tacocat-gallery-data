We talked a long time about the fisherman catching the crab, bringing it to the store, the store selling it to us, and us cooking and eating it.  We even played it out, with him as the crab.\n\n<p>\nHe was all excited to eat it, but when it came he didn't like it.  So Dean cut up a hot dog, called it a crab, and he chowed down.\n</p>",

    "description": "Felix is the cutest, most adorable, and most enjoyable little boy.  In times past we had a pleasurable feeling of anticipation, waiting for him to do some new skill or to start talking more.  Now we're a little awed by how fast he's learning, and we look at older kids and think, \"No!  We're not ready!  We haven't had him long enough like he is right now!\"   He's <i>that</i> fun.\n\n<p>\nOne morning this week he woke up, padded into our room, shook Dean on the shoulder, and said, \"Love you, papa!\"  That definitely woke Dean up.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSchool's good.  He had a play date with Phoebe, an older woman from his class.  She's three.   They get along well.  And the other day, the class was talking about babies and he said, sadly, \"my baby no come yet\".\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the potty training front, he did his first premeditated poop.\n</p>",

    "description": "</TD>\n</TR>\n</TABLE>\n<P>\n<P>\nMilo turned 3 months old today.  To celebrate, we had our first supper in a restaurant with the newly super-sized family.  Felix was adorable, and Milo slept through the entire birthday meal.  It couldn't have worked out better.\n\n<p>\nMost kids learn to count by first memorizing the sequence of 1 to 10, then start applying that sequence to quantities of stuff.  Felix has done the opposite:  he still can't keep the sequence straight (he'll start at 4, skip 7, and often peter out before 10), but he knows how to apply a sequence to a quantity.   At breakfast he pointed to the things in front of him and said, \"I'm counting.  Surimi, tartine, water, cereal.  I have cereal.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA Berkeley moment:  Felix saw a Lego guy bending over and said, \"Look!  Doing Tai Chi!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix has become an expert at spotting 'F'.  Most recently he saw \"fuck\" grafittied on a wall and said, \"Look!  An F!  An F for Felix!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSee <a href=\"sailing/index.htm\">pictures of Dean sailing</a> with people you probably don't know.\n</p>",

    "description": "Even though Felix has been very sweet with Milo, it was clear even before the birth that he was anxious about whatever changes might be coming.  He's been extremely attached to Dean and quick to melt down at things that would never have phased him before.  Also, he hasn't been growing up at the blistering pre-Milo rate: not many new abilities or language skills, and a lack of interest in doing new things.  He's been wanting to stay at home and play Legos and trains and pretend.\n\n<p>\nI'm happy to say that, as of this weekend, Felix is back on course.  The tantrums receded, he's not clinging to Dean, and his grammar has been graced in the last few days by the appearance of I, us, he and him.  (Though he says \"nus\", a mixture of \"nous\" and \"us\".) Today we played soccer outside and rode his tricycle to the local playground, both firsts.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCheck out this <a href=\"audio/RowYourBoat.wav\">audio file</a> of Dean and Felix singing <i>Row, Row, Row Your Boat</i>.\n</p>",

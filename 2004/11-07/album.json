Dean and Lucie got to explore a few more Berkeley restaurants, including the birthplace of what they call \"california cuisine\", Chez Panisse.\n\n<p>\nMilo was an overachiever this week.   He started grabbing stuff (actually last week), laughing, and rolling over.  He's absolutely figured out that his hands are his, that they belong in his mouth, and that they can be used to hold on to toys.  He seems pretty pleased with his achievements, and just keeps getting more smiley.  It's like the kid is made of smiles.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix has also been adorable.  He plays very gently with Milo:  Milo especially seems to enjoy it when Felix rubs their faces together in a smooshy brother hug.  Felix has been very affectionate with Dean and Lucie lately, too.\n</p>",

    "description": "This has been a weekend of adrenaline-pumping entertainment for Felix.\n<p>\nOn Saturday he went to the movies for the very first time.  We saw Shrek 2. It has an ogre in it!  Scary!  We munched a hotdog and fought for control of the popcorn bag throughout the show.  Felix enjoyed it, though he did find the loud sound, the darkness, and the humongous screen a bit intimidating. He stayed curled up in Dean's lap the entire time.\n<p>\nOn Sunday, the 4th of July, Felix saw his first fireworks.  We knew he was going to be scared, because he had pretended to watch fireworks earlier in the day and he pretended he was scared by them then.  At the actual thing, he was both in awe and sort of scared (\"peur! peur!\"), and stayed burrowed in a blanket in Dean's arms.   The show was in Oakland, and Dean and Lucie were delighted with it: after years of colored fogs in San Francisco, it felt great to see some real fireworks under clear skies.  Hooray for the East Bay!",

    "description": "With Milo getting older and starting to grudgingly accept milk from bottles, he and Lucie are becoming slightly more separate entities.   The YMCA gym has an excellent babysitter program for children two months and older.   On Milo's two month birthday, he spent an hour with them while Lucie swam.  It was great:  she dropped off a screaming infant and when she returned, Milo and a caretaker were both curled up asleep in a rocking chair!  And this weekend we went to an actual rock concert.  We were gone <i>six hours</i>.  Sylvie kept both little Moseses and Evan as well, while Jason and Janice went with us to the concert.  All parties has a fantabulous time.\n\n<p>\nFor the last month or two, Felix has been thinking a lot about the concept of friends.  It's clearly important to him that he have them -- he talks about various people or toy animals as being his friends, and acts out scenes where two friends talk about how they're friends.   He loves having playdates, saying happily \"I see mes amis!\".  One of his favorite books right now is <i>When Pigasso met Mootisse</i>, in which a pig artist and a bull artist are friends, they get mad at each other because one of them doesn't like the other's paintings, but then become friends again when they see that they miss each other.  As Felix puts it:  \"They's amis, then no amis, then amis!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe always says \"I play tout seul <i>(all alone)</i>\" when asked who he played with at school.  But we no longer believe him:  the teachers say he has quite a few friends, and Lucie often takes him to the playground with friends after school, where he has a blast.     Yet when Dean asks him who he played with at the playground, he'll <i>still</i> say he played all alone.  We guess he picked up our desire for him to have a social network, and is playing on it for sympathy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlso, Felix is starting to have an opinion on his clothes.  He's got several shirts that he asks for.  The one with fish is his favorite.  He likes fish so much we're thinking of getting an aquarium.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCheck out this <a href=\"audio/SupperRocketShip.wav\">audio file</a> of Dean and Felix at supper pretending his yogurt spoon is a rocket ship</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>",

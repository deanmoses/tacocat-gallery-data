    "description": "</TD>\n</TR>\n</TABLE>\n<P>\n<P>\nMerry Christmas!\n\n<p>\nWe had a great Christmas, for which we are truly thankful.  The last few had fallen short of our usual experience of holiday joy:\n<br/>&#149; 2003: we were at Church St. and the family had a horrible flu.\n<br/>&#149; 2002: we were in France and Felix had horrible jet lag.\n<br/>&#149; 2001:  we were at Holly Park, Felix had just been born, and was having problems feeding.\n<br/>&#149; 2000:  Lucie had just miscarried, and we were feeling pretty down.\n</p>\n\nThis year, however, everyone was healthy, noone was jet-lagged, we were rejoicing in a new family member, and everyone knew how to eat.   It was a comfy, cozy at-home celebration with Nana, filled with good food and home-baked madeleines.\n\n<p>\nMilo is sitting unassisted -- though he's not nearly as into it as Felix was at the same age. Also, he is getting better at rolling from his belly to his back; and he is even starting to crawl commando-style very <i>very</i> slightly.  We hesistate to mark it as \"first crawl\", but at least it's some sort of self-propulsion.\n</p>",

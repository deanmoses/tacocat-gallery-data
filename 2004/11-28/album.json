    "description": "Happy Thanksgiving!\n\n<p>\nMilo turned 4 months old.  He celebrated by getting an ear infection.  He's been a real trouper:  whimpering and crying a lot, but it's still easy to get him smiling.   Doctors are really reluctant to prescribe antibiotics, so we had to wait a few days until he <i>also</i> got an upper respiratory infection before being able to get them.  It's been a rough couple of nights because he coughs himself awake.  Lucie's been staying up with him half the night in a steamy bathroom to get him less congested.  Hopefully now he's going to start getting better.\n</p>",

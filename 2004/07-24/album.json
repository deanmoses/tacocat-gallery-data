    "description": "The Moses family has grown by a Milo!  <b>Milo Zane Moses</b> came into the world at 7:30 this morning (Saturday July 24).  Mother and child are doing great.\n\n<p>\nMilo weighs 9 lbs 2 oz, and is 22 inches long.  He has two eyes.  One nose.  Five fingers on each of his two hands.    He has really long toes.  And he's cute cute cute.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen Milo came out, he was immediately placed on Lucie's chest.  He was alert and looking at us.  We stuck our tongues out at him.  He stuck his tongue out right back at us.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nLabor and delivery happened in the early morning, while Felix was asleep.  Austin came over to the house (I didn't think it was possible to cross the San Francisco Bay that quickly) and they hung out for the day.  Felix has shown some spots of anxiety about mom and dad being gone, but is generally okay.   Nana flew in tonight, so Felix is getting lots of loving.\n</p>",

    "description": "Milo at his 4 month checkup was 26 and 3/9 inches (68cm) long and weighed 15 lbs 1 oz (6.8kg), which is three pounds lighter than Felix at the same age.  He's over his big sickness and Felix is mostly over his little sickness.  This has put them both in high spirits.  As is usual after a baby sickness, Milo is taking great leaps forward.  He decided to try his hand at sitting, and he's been a shameless flirt.  We can't take him out of the house without him stopping everyone on the street with big ol' smiles.\n\n\n<p>\nDean and Milo have conversations that consist of grunting back and forth.  Milo actually imitates Dean's mouth position during these conversations... the kid really wants to communicate.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix is gaining more confidence in his language and becoming more social because of it.  New this week is initiating conversations with strangers.  He'll tell them that the croissants look yummy and that he likes the chocolate ones the best, or that we're going to the store.  He's also correcting Dean's English sometimes:  even little nitpicky things like a misused preposition.\n</p>",

    "description": "Dean was in Washington DC for some of the week visiting Nana.  He kept in touch with Felix with amusing and somewhat confusing phone calls:\n<br /><u>Dean</u>:  Hi Felix!\n<br /><u>Felix</u>:  Bateau!\n<br /><u>Dean</u>:  How are you, Felix?\n<br /><u>Felix</u>:  Hi Papa!\n<br /><u>Dean</u>:  What did you do today?\n<br /><u>Felix</u>:  Papa!\n\n<p>\nWatching Felix play is lots of fun.  He'll act out entire scenes from a book or real life, with the most unusual props.   His favorite scenes of the moment:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tirelessly recreating Dean's trip to Nana's.  A pillow stars as Nana, and Mr. Potato head is one of the suitcases.</li>\n\t<li>Has his stuffed animals go home (a box), sleep, wake up, eat, then go back to sleep.  Over and over.</li>\n\t<li>Fishing.  The bucket's very important.  You <i>always</i> put the fish in the bucket.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis sentences are getting more grammatically correct: the words are in the right order, though the little words in between are still missing. For example, he will say \"no go outside, want stay home\", \"watch! airplane land airport!\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn Monday morning, during the car ride to Sylvie's, Lucie and Felix were telling Evan about their week-end:\n<br /><u>Lucie</u>: Au park, on a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 manger aux canards. <i>(at the park, we fed the\nducks)</i>\n<br /><u>Felix</u>: Coin no faim, no eat pain. <i>(but the ducks weren't hungry, they didn't eat the bread)</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA cute addition to his vocabulary and his behavior: when things don't turn out as hoped, instead of getting frustrated, Felix often just shrugs it off and says \"oh well\".\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHe got his first number:  two.  One evening he very clearly insisted that Dean read the TWO books he had in his hand.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen we drive, Felix is getting very interested about why we do things. He knows all about red lights. He is being a bit of a backseat driver, though, telling us to slow down and to be more careful (\"No fast! No crash!\").\n</p>",

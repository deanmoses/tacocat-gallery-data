    "description": "Milo's second week of existence was good.  So far, it hasn't been as difficult as we thought it would be.   Partly it's that he's a good eater and sleeper, and partly it's our expectations:  if Milo's still crying after he's been fed, changed and burped, that's HIS problem.  We'll hold him but we don't get too worked up over the crying.  I think the fact that we are less stressed makes Milo less stressed and cry less.",

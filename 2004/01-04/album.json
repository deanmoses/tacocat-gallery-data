    "description": "The good news is that Felix is completely over the flu.  The bad news is that Lucie has had the flu and now has a sinus infection.  The fun times just aren't stopping this holiday season.\n\n<p>\nDean's been on vacation for the entire winter holidays -- more than two weeks -- which has been good because he's been keeping Felix a lot while Lucie's hacking up a lung.  The guys have been doing some bonding.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOn the language front, new words are popping every day. We are not keeping an exhaustive list, but here's an idea:\n<ul>\n<li><b>French words</b> - ca (this), joujou (toy), cadeau (present), tartine (bread with butter and jam), couche (diaper), dents (teeth), sable (sand), pont (bridge), 'nel (tunnel), docteur (doctor), coupe (to cut, his only French verb).\n<li><b>English words</b> - what's that?, that, there, over there, see, want, wake up, hug, cry, sad, wet, dark, big, stuck, dirty, high, hot, cold, closed, open, hard (as in difficult), chair (also meaning \"to sit\"), crayon (also meaning \"to draw\"), backpack, door, cooking, steam, hair, hand, feet, shirt, boots, rain (also meaning \"umbrella\"), sky, moon, star, light, tree, truck, cup, milk, water, cow, pig, fish, bird, light, top, ladder, guy.\n<li><b>French to English</b> - Except for a very few exceptions, Felix uses either a French or an English word for something, but not both. Lately, a few of his French words have been replaced by English ones:\n<i>main</i> has been replaced by <i>hand</i>, <i>sale</i> by <i>dirty</i>, <i>l'eau</i> by <i>water</i>, <i>jus</i> by <i>juice</i>, <i>assis</i> by <i>chair</i>, <i>chat</i> by <i>cat</i>.\n<li><b> Disappearing baby signs</b> - Almost all of Felix's baby signs have fallen into disuse. A very few remain:\n<br>\n    [<u>fingers tapping palm</u>] <i>more</i>, for emphasis... especially useful \n    when his mouth is full of whatever he wants more of. <br>\n    [<u>palms opening</u>] <i>book</i>, for clarification... his \"book\"and his \n    \"bottle\" sound a lot alike (\"bo\"), and both are things he requests when tired. \n    <br>\n    [<u>hand to ear</u>] <i>did you hear that sound?</i>, for speed... coupled \n    with saying \"what's that?\" \n</ul>\n</p>",

That puts him in the 90th percentile height-wise, and 70th percentile weight-wise.\n<p>\nMilo is smiling and cooing more and more. We are all enjoying it. As Felix puts it, \"Baby smiles at me! Baby likes me!\"  Sometimes when Milo's crying, the best way to soothe him is to actually put him down and just smile and coo at him.  Often he will start smiling and cooing back.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTalking with Felix can be just about the most fun thing ever.  Recent bedtime conversation:\n<ul>\n<u>Dean</u>: (<i>singing</i>) Home, home on the range...\n<br><u>Felix</u>:  What's a range?\n<br><u>Dean</u>:  It's kind of like a really big farm.\n<br><u>Felix</u>:  Has cows?\n<br><u>Dean</u>:  Has buffalo cows.  (<i>singing</i>) Where the buffalo roam...\n<br><u>Felix</u>:  Has monkeys?\n<br><u>Dean</u>:  No, it's a farm, not a zoo.  (<i>singing</i>) And the skies...\n<br><u>Felix</u>:  Has chickens?\n<br><u>Dean</u>:  Yes!  Can I sing now?\n</ul>\n\n</p>",

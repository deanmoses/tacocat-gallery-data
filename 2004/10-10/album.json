    "description": "For a few days this week, the serene tranquility of the Moses household was shattered like a stack of cheap plates at a Greek wedding.   We had 5 houseguests:  Mary (Dean's aunt), Papajohn (Dean's dad), Linda (Papajohn's wife), Ron and Kay (friends of the family).   Okay, so maybe we didn't actually have any tranquility to begin with, and our guests more than pulled their own weight around the house, but several things <i>were</i> shattered over the course of the weekend.\n\n<p>\nWe had a great time and believe they did, though we're sure a few more bedrooms and bathrooms would have been appreciated.  That we had fun was somewhat remarkable because Lucie is sick and Felix actually has pneumonia.  He's been on antibiotics since Wednesday and has been amazingly chipper, if a little low energy.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFelix was quite happy with the crowd.  The few times he and Dean found themselves alone, Felix would look around and ask, \"Where mes amis?\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\nMilo is proving to be a very social baby, and was interested and involved in all the commotion in the times he wasn't hungry, tired, or pooping.\n</p>",

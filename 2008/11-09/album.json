All day, everywhere we went, the mood was electric.  </p><p>There were tons of election parties in the evening.  The one we went to was at an EB classmate's, in Berkeley hills with a soaring view of the bay, a swimming pool and a hot tub.   Amusingly, there were \"Obama for the Middle Class\" posters plastered all over this decidedly upper-class mansion.  We cheered from the pool as the TV announced each state falling to Barack Obama.  When he gave his victory speech, people were crying and hugging each other.</p><p>Lucie proudly wore her <strong>I Voted</strong> sticker all day.</p>",

She's learning all about the branches of the federal government, and the nicknames of the presidents.  <em>Why</em> did they call Andrew Jackson \"Olde Inky Dink\"?<p>Even though both kids have made good friends at camp, they're a little tired of it.  They keep asking, \"When can we go back to Ecole Bilingue?\".  It's nice to know they really like their school...  Felix, though, is really proud that he passed to the next level in swim class.</p>",

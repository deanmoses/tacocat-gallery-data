  "description": "The kids have been on Christmas vacation  -- and hence Lucie too -- for more than two weeks.  Tomorrow morning we ship their adorable derrières back to school.   After Lucie, Milo's the most excited about it:  almost every day he asks if it's a school day.<p>Felix and Milo have used the two weeks at home to start mastering the computer.  They've got a couple of websites they like, with kid puzzles and games, and they've figured out how iTunes works.  Dean is thinking it's time to turn off iTunes' \"click to buy\" option before anything hideously expensive happens.</p><p>One modern-age skill that both kids seem to have picked up naturally is turning off battery-powered devices when they're done with them.  We thought Milo's MP3 player turned off automatically, but no.  He just always turns it off.  It's the same for all their electronic toys and Dean's R2-D2.    Kudos!</p>",

From scratch!  There's about a billion little layers of pastry interleaved with layers of butter.   Lucie's New Year resolution is to cook new and exciting high-butter recipes.</p>",

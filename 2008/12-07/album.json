She's used to 6 <em>week</em> contracts, so this is feeling like a VERY long engagement. <p>She's working on the website of <strong><a href=\"http://www.spore.com\">Spore</a></strong>, an award-winning video game.  It's conveniently located 5 minutes from Ecole Bilingue. The product is great, the people are cool, the schedule is flexible.  Sweet!</p><p>The kids love the game.  When they play it, they are convinced they're helping mom with her job. Lucie is happy to have them relate to her work, for once.</p>",

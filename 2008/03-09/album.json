  "description": "Felix had his six-year checkup a few months too late.<ul><li>55 1/4 lbs - 25kg</li><li>47 1/4 inches - (1.2m) - almost 4 feet!</li></ul><p>Felix is loving school.  He really likes all of his many teachers and is interested in what they teach. Garden class, yoga and Mad Science are definitely his faves.   His dexterity with things like scissors is shooting through the roof and his handwriting is excellent, especially compared to his non-French-school friends.  Go Felix!</p><p>Milo's also growing.  In particular, he's becoming more aware and considerate.  His \"sorrys\" are more heartfelt, he's following rules better, and when we're correcting his behavior, he mostly actually listens, rather than trying to tra-la-la away.   </p><p>Lucie's working too much -- got sucked into one too many projects -- and that's chafing against her French heritage and her mom genes.</p><p>Dean's working a lot and enjoying (almost) every minute of it.   Apparently there's less friction with the American heritage and dad genes.</p>",

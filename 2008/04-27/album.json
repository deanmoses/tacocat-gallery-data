  "description": "Second week of Spring Break and Baboushka's visit. We had a mellow time: playdates with classmates, visits to kids' museums, bike rides, cooking, and a trip to the baseball park to see the Oakland A's play. <p>The week finished with a shot of adrenaline. Milo dislocated his elbow while Dean was swinging him.  It didn't LOOK hurt -- no swelling or anything -- but Milo was crying hard and he never does that.  We went to the emergency room, where the doctor effortlessly popped the arm right back in place. Milo was back to wrestling with Felix an hour later, none the worse for wear. Little kids are made of rubber!</p>",

The Rim Fire, as it is being called, caused camp to be evacuated on Tuesday, August 20.<p>As of today, Thursday, August 22, the Rim Fire covers 85 square miles and has almost reached Tuolumne Camp. We are safely back home and anxiously checking the news. </p><p>We hope our beloved camp survives this catastrophe.</p><p></p><div><b><u>Update Monday, Aug 26</u></b></div> Very sadly, the entire camp burned to the ground last evening, and the Rim Fire continues to grow.  At more than 250 square miles, it's now the 14th largest fire in California history.<p>  The pictures on the news show that the devastation is complete and total.  We attended a ceremony in a Berkeley park today with hundreds of other campers to commemorate our beloved Berkeley Tuolumne Camp. </p><div><b><u>Update Oct 1</u></b></div>The Rim Fire turned out to be the third largest fire in California history, and the Sierra Nevada's most destructive fire in centuries.  400 square miles (257,314 acres) burned.",

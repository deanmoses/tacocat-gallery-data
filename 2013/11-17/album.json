Lucie went as a chaperone and also had a great time. <a href=\"http://tacocat.com/pictures/v/2013/11-17/coloma2/\">Here are some extra photos from Coloma</a>.  <p>In other news, San Francisco was transformed into Gotham city for a day to satisfy the wish of a 5-year-old cancer victim. He had asked the Make-A-Wish Foundation if he could become Batman. There was on outpouring of support: thousands of people volunteered to help make his wish a reality. </p><p>That morning, with the batkid story on the radio, Lucie explained the Make-a-Wish foundation to the kids:</p><div style=\"margin-left:1em;margin-right:2em\"><dt><b>Milo</b></dt><dd>Is it for adults too?! They could have taken grand-p√®re to Disney World or something before he died!</dd><dt><b>Lucie</b></dt><dd>No, it's just for kids <em>[mind churning to come up with an explanation]</em></dd><dt><b>Felix</b></dt><dd>I know why. Adults have had a chance to accumulate lots of happy memories. But kids have had a shorter life, they need the help.</dd></div>",

  "description": "On Friday 11/11/11 (the last binary date of the century!), we had our first parent-teacher conferences of the year. To our delight, both kids were praised as hard-working, smart, well-behaved, involved in their work, interested and interesting. Our year in France is being felt: they made huge progress in French but their spelling in English is suffering, especially Felix. We'll need to work on that. Also, Milo tends to rush too much through his work, in a misguided quest to finish before Ulysses. Another area to improve on. <p>Also on 11/11/11 (yeah! another chance to write down this noteworthy date), Dean and Lucie went out for a lovely dinner with Freeform and Anna while the children were babysat by Matt√©o, the teenage son of the family who lived in our house last year. </p><p>Dean and Lucie went out again the following night, to Renee's awesome 40th birthday party. This time, the kids had sleepovers at Teddy's and Connor's.</p>",

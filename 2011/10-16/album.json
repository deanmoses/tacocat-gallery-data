  "description": "Big week for Milo: he earned his second yellow stripe in karate and, at long last, he has a wiggly tooth! <p>While most kids start losing baby teeth at 5 or 6, Milo went through kindergarten and first grade without a single visit from the tooth fairy.  Felix, by contrast, lost his first tooth the summer before kindergarten and had lost 8 teeth by the end of first grade. </p><p>At age 5, Milo was frantic about wanting to lose teeth like Felix.  He would tug them in a vain effort to loosen them. By age 6, he had grown philosophical and figured it would happen any week now. By age 7, he began to doubt it would EVER happen... perhaps he would grow up to be the only teenager with baby teeth? </p><p>Now that it is finally happening, he delights in playing with his tooth with his tongue, savoring every wiggle before it falls out.</p>",

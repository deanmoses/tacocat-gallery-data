The house feels very quiet.<p>May 1 is labor day in France. Mostly, it gets celebrated by not working. In keeping with the spirit of La Fête du Travail, we did little this weekend and took very few photos. Enjoy the downtime before the next round of frenetic adventures.</p>",

This was in an effort to de-emphasize the communist heritage of Labor Day. Before World War II, red rosehip was the preferred flower on May 1st (then called <i>La Fête des Travailleurs</i> instead of <i>La Fête du Travail</i>)</p>",

After months of sloppiness, he is carefully holding his pen at last. <p>Recently, Milo's teacher declared that his handwriting is so bad that she will give him one-on-one session during lunch break, twice a week. At first, Milo was humiliated and cried bitter tears. But he quickly changed his attitude and now he seems determined to prove his teacher wrong. It worked out nicely that his first session fell on his half birthday. </p>",

  "description": "It's good to be back in the Bay Area. We have quickly readjusted to life as we used to know it.  France already seems a distant memory.<p>The house felt slightly off at first. Its denizens had moved furniture around, rearranged the cupboards in the kitchen and relegated some items to the garage (where, sadly, our bean bag chair and the kids' rug caught fatal cases of mold). Also, we had put a lot of stuff away in boxes. Now, things are back to where they belong. It feels like home again.</p><p>We are visiting friends, strolling through favorite neighborhoods and sampling all the food we missed (Semifreddi's Cinnamon Bread, burritos from Taqueria Cactus, and so many more!). Lucie is particularly happy to be reunited with her bike, her yoga studio and the YMCA's swimming pool. Felix and Milo can't get enough of their Lego Room and Rohai Dojo.  </p><p>All is well in the world.</p>",

This weekend we descended into the rocky bowels of the city for a spine-tingling tour of the Catacombs, where millions of our fellow citizens' bones are piled in ghoulish walls.</p><p>The teachers went on strike again (along with many others) this Thursday.  It's still about the retirement age rising from 60 to 62.   Psychologically, removing that day from the school week feels huge:  instead of 4 days of school a week (Wednesday's not a school day) and 3 days of non-school, it's flipped and the kids are learning fewer days than they're playing.  </p>",

That's a good thing because it leaves us time and energy to do some English homework.   We're using the same spelling book he would have used in Berkeley this year.</p><p>Milo's doing English homework, too.   He can read simple books.  For him, reading's just happening, without any explicit instruction in the rules of the language.  This is in stark contrast to Felix, who had to painstakingly learn each rule and practice it a million times.</p><p>Felix had to learn discipline and perseverance in learning to read, skills which will stand him in good stead throughout his life.  Since everything comes so easy to Milo so far, self-discipline is a foreign concept. </p>",

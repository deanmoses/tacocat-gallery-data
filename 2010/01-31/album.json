  "description": "Lucie spent this week in Boston for work, yet again.  We're all pretty tired of it.  Dean took every chance to remind Lucie, trapped in Boston's cold and slush, that last week's rains had stopped and the sun was gently bathing Berkeley in a warming golden glow.<p>Austin came for a few days midweek to help out Dean.  It was fun:  Dean doesn't usually have a competitive soul in the house.  The tournament on the Nintendo Wii balance board was FEROCIOUS.</p><p>Felix and Milo are both getting into their karate and soccer classes, respectively.   The family definitely feels older, what with both kids into extracurricular activities.</p>",

  "description": "It's been a busy week! We still haven't managed to get mobile phones or a fully functioning bank account, but we did get officially matriculated with the social security administration. Just in time too:  on the day our American health insurance expired, Milo broke his wrist. So far, socialized medicine has delivered:  full treatment, no bills.<p>Thursday was \"la rentrée des classes\" (back-to-school). Despite a scare at first (Felix got put in the wrong grade), all went well in the end. Both Felix and Milo like their teachers and they have made a friend each. Lucie is in love with \"La Cantine\" (the cafeteria)… no making school lunches for a whole year!!! The kids are served a hot, balanced, sit-down meal they actually eat and enjoy.  </p><p>This weekend was \"Le Forum des Associations\": a back-to-school ritual across France, where you go and choose after-school activities for the kids. We are leaning toward Vovinam Viet Vo Dao, a vietnamese martial art reminiscent of Cuong Nhu, the martial art practiced at the kids' dojo in Berkeley. Felix is going next week for a trial class. Stay tuned.</p>",

We were stunned. </p>We spent the day worrying and looking for a solution. Fortunately, when we picked up Felix from school in the afternoon, he said he had been transferred to 3rd grade after lunch.

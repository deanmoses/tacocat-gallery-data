Austin's moved in to help wrangle the kids, for which Dean will be eternally grateful.<p>Austin, Dean and the boys are living the bachelor lifestyle.   So far, this means:</p><ul>   <li>Legos have taken precedence over food on the kitchen table.</li>   <li>Plates became optional somewhere along the line.</li>   <li>Pizza forms a King Tut-sized chunk of the food pyramid.</li>   <li>Bathing was never our strong suit, but... let's just say we're doing our bit to eliminate California's drought.</li></ul><p>Also, and I'm not sure if this is bachelor-ey or not, but we've discovered milkshakes.  Not only are they tasty, you get to operate the blender!</p>",

It involves more strategy than Felix and Milo are used to in their games, so Dean's been happy to find an educational component to Milo's addiction.  We've been discussing tactics over meals.</p>",

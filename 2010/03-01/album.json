  "description": "Lucie's 7-month long contract ended this week. As if on cue, Milo got sick. As soon as he got better, Felix got sick. Once both kids were back in school, it was Lucie's turn to catch the bug and spend a day in bed. While it hasn't been a particularly fun week, Lucie did appreciate how considerate this virus has been in waiting until AFTER her work was wrapped up. Plus, we were all more of less back on our feet by the week-end.",

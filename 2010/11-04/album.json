Four thousand skeletons dating between 1528 and 1870 were used to decorate the chapel.</p><p>Our favorite is the Grim Reaper in this photo: the blade of his scythe is a column of tail bones, and he's holding a bone scale to weigh the souls of the dead.</p><p>The whole joint serves to remind people of their mortality, as stated by an inscription near the mummified remains of one monk:</p><p><i>“Quello che voi siete noi eravamo, Quello che noi siamo voi sarete.” - What you are now we were, What we are you will be.</i></p>",

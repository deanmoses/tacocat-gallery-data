That's what he's been doing most of the week.</p><p>It definitely put a cramp in our efforts to pack up the house.  For instance, he was going to sell the motorcycle, but now it'll just have to get mothballed.</p><p>Fortunately, THIS weekend he's doing much better and will be able to walk onto the plane.

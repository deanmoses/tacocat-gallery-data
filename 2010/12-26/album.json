  "description": "Joyeux Noël from Paris!<p>This is the first year we know for sure that Felix doesn't believe in Santa.  He was on a Skype video chat with a friend in Berkeley and we overheard them discussing the matter.  Friend whispers, \"Do you think Santa is your parents?\"  Felix whispers back, \"Y - E - S\".</p><p>We've suspected Felix hasn't actually believed in Santa since he was four;  we don't think he's ever going to bring it up himself.  Given that Milo still believes, Felix is being very considerate and not bursting Milo's Santa bubble.</p><p>Milo is starting to have his doubts, though, as evidenced by this very philosophical bedtime conversation:<br />\" - Mommy, does Santa really exist?<br />- What do you think? <br />- I just don't know. I have to find out for sure before I am a grown-up. What if I still believe in Santa when I am grown-up? I won't buy presents for my kids then. And if Santa doesn't exist, then my kids won't get any presents.<br />- That wouldn't be good. <br />- Kids can believe in Santa, but grown-ups have to know for sure.\"</p><p>We are impressed with Milo's very clear distinguishing between belief and knowledge.</p><p>And this is also surely the last Christmas that we'll be able to write stuff in the website without both Felix and Milo reading it.</p><p>This was the first time in years that Nana didn't make it for Christmas, and she was missed.  She was planning to come but there's been massive snow problems at the French airports so she canceled her ticket.  Instead, she's on a cruise in the Caribbean, hitting 7 countries in 7 days.  Remember your sunscreen, Nana!</p>",
